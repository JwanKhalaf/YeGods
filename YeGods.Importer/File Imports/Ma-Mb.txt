MA
Origin: Asia Minor
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
The tutelary goddess of Comana in ancient Cappadocia, modern south-central Asian Turkey. The area was Hittite territory. 'Ma' means 'mother' but her epithets 'Invincible' and 'Bringer of Victory' suggest her earth-mother attributes were tempered with warrior characteristics. According to tradition her temple rites were imported from Greece by ORESTES and his sister, but this is back-construction. The Greeks imagined her to be a form of the goddess ENYO, though she was compared to both CYBELE and BELLONA, and Plutarch considered her to be a manifestation of SEMELE or ATHENA. Her temple was popular and drew adherents from far afield. Temple properties and royalties made her ministrants very rich. A key ceremony was initiation into adulthood for both sexes, and involved sacred prostitution

She is closely associated with RA from the beginning and eventually becomes known as the ‘daughter of Ra.’ THOTH is sometimes given as her consort.

In the funerary papyri of the New Kingdom it is Ma’at who sits in judgement at the weighing of the heart ceremony in the Hall of the Two Truths. The heart of the deceased was weighed against the image of Ma’at, often represented simply by the ostrich feather. Her only known sanctuary was in Karnak

MAC CUILL
Origin: Celtic Ireland
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ETHUR
It is the way of Irish mythology to blur the distinction between deity and hero, and so it is with Mac Cuill (birth name Éthur). He is the son of Cermait, who is son of THE DAGDA, the 'good god'. His name comes from his attachment to the god of the hazel, COLL. His wife is Banba. Wikipedia has Mac Cuill and his brothers MAC CECHT and MAC GRÉINE killing LUG to avenge Cermait's death at Lug's hand. The brothers, by ancestry the TUATHA DÉ DANANN, became the last three High Kings of Ireland

MACHA
Origin: Celtic Ireland
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: DANA, BADB, NEMAIN, NEMHAIN, BADB, BODB, BADB CATHA, BADHBH, BODB DEARG, BLACK ANNIS
Daughter of ETRANGE. After coming to live in the house of a widower, Crunniuc, she became pregnant. The king of the Ulstermen forced her to take part in a race against his horses, refusing to listen to her plea that she was pregnant. She won the race, but give birth to twins and cursed the Ulstermen. Only the hero Cu Chulainn escaped this curse. She is one of a trio of goddesses of the Tuatha de Danann, the children of Danu, but the name is also a collective for the trio, as is ‘The MORRIGAN’. Macha’s other names are DANA and BADB or BADHBH or BODB ('Crow’ or ‘Raven’) The third goddess in the trio is NEMAIN or NEMHAIN. Though the goddesses’ attributes are those of an earth mother and female principle, all three delight in the slaughter of men. The heads of those slain are offered up to the Macha and are known as the ‘mesrad Machae’ or ‘Macha’s mast’. The goddesses are able to take the form of a crow or raven and have great gifts of prophecy: for instance, BADB turns up before the hero Cu Chulainn as Badb Catha, the crow of death, before he goes into battle. They could also influence the outcome of battle by magical means. They are similar in many respects to the Gaulish NANTOSUELTA. Morrigan or BLACK ANNIS surfaces in the Arthurian legend as MORGAN LE FAY

She receives the soul of a child from RADIEN, the world ruler deity, and gives it to her daughter SARAKKO to place in the womb. Her 'midwife' assistant at childbirth is the goddess UKSAKKA. The Finnish 'Old Woman of the Dead' is YAMBE-AKKA. There is a suggestion that Akka/Acco, and other similar combinations reaching back to AKKAdia/Sumer, may be etymologically connected to a proto-Indo-European root word meaning water; hence aqua, agua. See AKKA, ACCO

Aliases: MAFDEJ
A early (probably First Dynasty, 3000-2800BC) goddess associated with cats, and usually depicted as a woman with the head (and sometimes skin) of a cheetah or panther, her hair braided and ending in scorpion tails. Sometimes she wears a snake headdress. Her attributes include protection against snakes, scorpions and other dangerous animals, and healing those afflicted by such bites and stings. Her name means ‘runner’, presumably to describe her swiftness in attacking threats to those she protects: these appear to have included the pharaoh, whose harpoon, weapon of choice for the journey through the underworld, is decorated with Mafdet’s claws. She also appears to represent justice and judicial authority, certainly by the time of the new Kingdom. She has a link with the dwarf god BES. In the New Kingdom her parents are AMON and MUT. Her worship and attributes were gradually subsumed by those of the cat goddess BAST

MAGNA MATER
Origin: Asia Minor (Anatolia); Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: CYBELE, TERRA MATER, TELLUS, GAEA, ISIS
The name is Latin for 'Great Mother', the implication being that she is mother of all the gods. But her image – that of a well-endowed woman seated on a lion (or panther or leopard) throne and holding fruit or flowers – is first discovered in Çatalhöyük, in western Anatolia (Asian Turkey), and probably dates from 6000BC. If this clay figurine represents a deity, the image has elements that survive into classical times 6000 years later. She emerges as the Phrygian (central Asian Turkish) CYBELE, who became hugely popular in both Greece and Rome. The Greeks amalgamated her with RHEA and the Romans with TERRA (MATER) and TELLUS, but her enduring characteristics also associate her with GAEA and ISIS

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: DÀHĒITIĀ, DAIKOKUTEN, MAHĀKĀLI, KAL, GÖNPO NAGPO, SPYAN RAS GZIGS, 'KHOR LO BDE MCHOG
The Sanskrit name translates as 'beyond death' or 'beyond time'. In Hinduism Mahākāla is the consort of the goddess KALI. He is a terrifying four-armed, three-eyed creature living in cremation grounds and dressed in skulls. He sits on five corpses, covered in ashes and surrounded by screaming jackals and vultures. He carries a trident, drum, sword and scythe, all Hindu symbols of death. He and Kali, often pictured together, represent the unstoppable and ravaging nature of time and the ultimate destructive force of BRAHMAN as expressed through SHIVA, destroyer of all, including time. Mahākāli in this respect is a form of Kali and the female force or aspect – the sakti – of Mahākāla. As further confusion, Hindus in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh see Mahākāla as PARAMASHIVA, the ultimate godhead. In parts of northern Bengal wild elephants are worshipped as Mahākāla. However Mahākāla has a protective side to his nature and in northern India especially he is, with NANDI, one of Shiva's two doorkeepers, guarding the entrance to early Hindu temples. This protective nature carries over into Vajrayana Buddhism, in which he is a type of deity known as a dharmapala. Tibetan Buddhists see him as an emanation of AVALOKITEŚVARA and name him SPYAN RAS GZIGS or 'KHOR LO BDE MCHOG. In these manifestations he is usually depicted with a crown of five skulls, five evils translated into five wisdoms. Mahākāla is a protector deity in most Tibetan traditions, in Tangmi or esoteric Chinese Buddhism, and Shingon, Japanese esoteric Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists call him GÖNPO NAGPO. He is known as DÀHĒITIĀ in Chinese and DAIKOKUTEN in Japanese, where he is one of the seven lucky gods of the household: an image of him, holding a golden money-mallet, seated on bales of rice with mice nearby, is usually kept in the kitchen, symbolising prosperity. In Sikhism, Mahākāla is referred to as KAL, governor of Maya, the state of reality behind the illusion of material life

MAIA
Origin: Greek, Oscan, Etruscan, Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: MAIESTAS
An ancient Greek fertility goddess, originally from Arcadia, Maia arrives in Homeric times as the mother of HERMES by ZEUS. Hermes is thus half-brother to APOLLO. She is also the mother of MERCURY. In Greek maia means 'midwife'. A myth connecting her to ARCAS and CALLISTO establishes her stellar connections as one of the PLEIADES. Absorbed into the later Roman pantheon, she became the goddess of growth (her name linked to the Latin for 'larger' or 'greater'), and she was considered the female apect of VULCAN. Later, she was linked to TERRA (Earth), the Roman counterpart of GAIA, and thus into legends of the Good Goddess (BONA DEA), OPS, FAUNA, CARNA, JUNO and DAMIA. Maia, the Oscans’ earth mother, a fertility and spring deity, was assimilated into the Roman pantheon under the name of OPS, and by this route is also identified with Fauna, the Bona Dea and DAMIA. The association with Juno (Etruscan UNI) is from an inscription 'Uni Mae'

It's possible the name is little more than an epithet meaning 'life flow' or similar.

He also suggests links to HEKATE, the Oscans' DEIUA GENETA and EILEITHYIA, both birth goddesses, through the dog sacrifices. Modern commentators have suggested she is the numen of spirit of infant mortality – she is a deity who chooses whether a newborn should live or die

One of a triad of northern Arabic goddesses considered to be Allah’s daughters (with AL-LÃT and AL-UZZA. Their mother is DUSHRAT. Manat was considered to be the Nabataeans’ goddess of destiny or fate. Under Hellenisation, Manawat was associated – at Palmyra – with the Greek/Roman goddess Nemesis/Fate. She is also the hearth-goddess of Petra. As with AL‘UZZA, Manawat similarly does not emerge to any major role among the Nabataeans, judging from the relative infrequency with which she was invoked in ancient inscriptions. Her major domain would seem to have been around Hegra, although she, like her sisters Al-‘Uzza and Al-Lat, survived until the coming of Islam. Her image does not appear among the pre-Islamic ‘idols’ at Mecca, however, and she may never have been represented there

A chapel to Mandulis existed on the island of Philae in the approaches to the temple of Isis, but his principal surviving place of worship is in the temple of Kalabsha, ancient Talmis, resited above the Aswan High Dam in Lower Nubia and constructed on the site of an earlier New Kingdom sanctuary.

Mwuetsi complained of loneliness, so Maori created a woman, Massassi, the morning star, warning the man not to touch her. He was tempted, touched her, and Massassi gave birth next morning to plants and trees, which soon covered the earth. Maori took her away, but seeing Mwuetsi's tears gave him another woman, Morongo, the evening star, and again Mwuetsi was unable to resist. These two made love every night, and Morongo gave birth to each kind of animal, finally giving birth to divine children, who grew into adults that same day. Maori was angered and created a storm, so Mwuetsi and Morongo hid themselves and continued to copulate, producing the world's dangerous, violent and poisonous animals.

In the Irish tradition he is the son of DAGDA (DAGHDA), the ‘Good God’, and of BOANN, the personified sacred river of Ireland. On the Continent Maponos was the ‘Divine Son’ or ‘Divine Youth’. In Wales he appeared as MABON, the son of MODRON (AP MODRON) or MATRONA, the ‘Divine Mother’. He surfaces again in the Arthurian romances as Mabon, MABUZ or MABONAGRAIN.

MARDUK
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ASARLUHI, UTU
Marduk rose from an obscure deity in the third millennium BC to become one of the most important gods and the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon by the first millennium BC, the patron deity of Babylon. His origins as a storm, water or vegetation god have recently been challenged on etymological grounds. His name may be a construct from Marutuk, whence amar-utu (bull calf of the sun god UTU), and if so, he could be a city-god of Sippar, whose tutelary god from the third millennium BC was Utu. He is the son of EA (the Sumerians' ENKI, one of their primal triad of gods) and DAMKINA, and is the heir of AN(U). His consort is SARPANIT. In myths his superior power is handed over gladly by EA, who names him ASARLUHI, god of magic the suggestion being that the cultural prowess of Eridu, seat of Ea, was respected by the incoming Babylonians. However, in the Akkadian creation myth the Enûma Eliš he deposes ENLIL, senior god in the Sumerian triad, and battles with the female principle, TIAMAT, the deified ocean, killing her and creating the world from her body, thus arriving at the head of the Babylonian pantheon in what the priestly caste presumably hoped was an acceptable manner. He is the tutelary god of the once fabulously wealthy city of Esagila in Babylon. Marduk is syncretised with the gods ASALLUHI and UTU. He's often referred to as Bel, Akkadian for 'lord'. Hittite invaders carried away his idol but when Kassite rule of Babylon began in about 1595BC, the rules regained possession of the idol and reinstalled Marduk’s worship, where he quickly became the equivalent of the Kassites’ chief god SHUQAMUNA (SUGAMUNA), a god of war and the chase, and therefore also linked to NERGAL. In the Hammurabi period of Assyrian rule (c 1300BC), he is identified with JUPITER

Said to have been born in human form in 1502, the daughter of a chieftain from Yaracuay State, Venezuela, she is believed to still live in the mountain of Sorte in her home state.

The name means 'St Mary of the Jaguar'. Sorte, now a national park, is home to Maria Lionza's main altar and attracts pilgrims all year round from Venezuela and the Caribbean. Her day is October 12, and her principal shamans and priests celebrate their 'queen' that day in Sorte. She is either carried off by a serpent or becomes one when she looks into a lake

She is depicted slightly differently in each culture, but is commonly pictured as a beautiful woman sitting on an open lotus which is itself supported on the back of seven pigs, She has three heads, one of which is often that of a sow. In her wrathful state she rides a boar or a chariot drawn by seven boars. In Taoism she is DOU MU, 'Queen of Heaven', her constellation Ursa Major (plus two other stars) and thus has the epithet Dipper Mother.

MARS
Origin: Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: BELLANTE, GRADIVUS, MARS PATER, MAYORS, MAMERS
Mars is the equivalent of the Greek ARES, and as such is the god of war. His early history shows fertility origins; he defends cattle, boundaries, fields, and wards off disease, and sponsors spring, growth in nature, and agriculture. These aspects suggest links with CERUS or Rome's tutelary god QUIRINUS, and he is invoked with CERUS and JUPITER at the Umbrian town of Iguvium (modern Gubbio), all three being associated with GRABOVIUS. His early names included MAYORS and MAMERS. The Oscans worshipped him as BELLANTE and he appears on a bronze mirror as MARIS TUISTES, not connected with MARIS. As one of the DII CONSENTES, major deities of the Roman pantheon, he is the son of JUNO by virgin birth: she conceives him from a lily, though in other stories his father is JUPITER. He is the brother of BELLONA and husband of NERIO - and of terror, revenge and courage. He is the chief god of the Roman soldier, and is awakened to battle by generals striking his sacred shield and crying ‘Mars vigila!’ As god of war he is M. GRADIVUS, The Strider. And he takes into war PAVOR and PALLOR, who fill enemies with fear and confusion. He is regarded as the father of the Roman people (M. PATER, festival March 1) because he fathered Romulus and Remus, legendary founders of Rome. His festivals were in March – the month is named after him – and October. His altar was in the Campus Martius, his temple on the Via Appia outside Rome, though in 2BCE August built a Temple of Mars Ultor (Mars the Avenger) in the Forum Augusti, commemorated on June 1. The entire month of March is dedicated to (and named after) him, the Salii performing a dancing procession with the ancillae throughout Rome. His festivals are the Equirria, celebrated with contests for war steeds on February 27, the Tubilustrium on 23 March, as Mars Invictus on 14 May, the Equus on October 15 and the Armilustrium on October 19

They ride in golden chariots pulled by red horses and live in the north, and have iron teeth and golden helmets and breastplates.

In the later Puranas they are born from the broken womb of DITI after Indra hurls a thunderbolt at her to prevent her giving birth to someone stronger than himself

MARY
Origin: Christian
Sex: F
Category: Spirit
Aliases: MOTHER OF GOD, THEOTOKOS, QUEEN OF HEAVEN, BLESSED VIRGIN
Though no contemporary faiths see Mary, mother of JESUS, as divine, she has several attributes that attest she is viewed as somewhat more than merely human. In the Christian religion, she is venerated by Catholics and some Anglicans and regarded as a saint – and therefore receptive of prayer and capable of intercession with God on behalf of humankind. Catholic dogma says that, like her son, she was immaculately conceived; that she was impregnated by the Holy Spirit; that despite giving birth to Jesus she remained a virgin all her life; and that she was bodily assumed into Heaven either at death or immediately before it. She is seen by Catholics as 'more honoured than the cherubim and seraphim'. Islam also venerates Mary as the immaculately-conceived mother of a messiah. Titles include Theotokos ('God-bearer' or 'mother of God'), Queen of Heaven, and The Blessed Virgin
