Thor’s family includes son MAGNI (with the giantess JARNSAXA) and THRUD(R), MÓDI and LORIDI with Sif.

Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Hero

Thyestes is the son of PELOPS, King of Olympia, and HIPPODAMIA. He is the father of PELOPIA and AEGISTHUS. Thyestes and his twin brother, ATREUS, were exiled by their father for having murdered their half-brother CHRYSIPPUS in their desire for the throne. They took refuge in Mycenae, where they ascended the throne as a favour to King EURYSTHEUS, who was later killed fighting the Heracleidae. Atreus vowed to sacrifice his best lamb to ARTEMIS. Upon searching his flock, however, Atreus discovered a golden lamb which he gave to his wife, AEROPE, to hide from the goddess. She gave it to her lover, Thyestes (Atreus' s brother), who then convinced Atreus to agree that whoever had the lamb should be king. Thyestes produced the lamb and claimed the throne. Atreus retook the throne using advice he received from HERMES. Thyestes agreed to give the kingdom back when the sun moved backwards in the sky, a feat that ZEUS accomplished. Atreus retook the throne and banished Thyestes. Atreus then learned of Thyestes' and Aerope's adultery and plotted revenge. He killed Thyestes' sons and cooked them, save their hands and heads. He served Thyestes his own sons and then taunted him with their hands and heads. An oracle then advised Thyestes that, if he had a son with his own daughter PELOPIA, that son would kill Atreus. Thyestes did so and the son, AEGISTHUS, did kill Atreus. However, when Aegisthus was first born, he was abandoned by his mother, ashamed of her incestuous act. A shepherd found the infant Aegisthus and gave him to Atreus, who raised him as his own son. Only as he entered adulthood did Thyestes reveal the truth to Aegisthus, that he was both father and grandfather to the boy and that Atreus was his uncle. Aegisthus then killed Atreus. Aegisthus and Thyestes ruled over Mycenae jointly, exiling Atreus' sons, AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS to Sparta, where King Tyndareus gave the pair their wives, his daughters, CLYTEMNESTRA and HELEN. When Tyndareus died, he gave his throne to Menelaus, who then helped Agamemnon overthrow Aegisthus and Thyestes

Sex: M

Myth connects Triptolemus with DEMETER who, while searching for her daughter PERSEPHONE, was received warmly by Celeus, king of Eleusis in Attica. Triptolemus was his sick son. Demeter gave him breast milk and he instantly recovered and became an adult. She taught him the art of agriculture and instructed him to fly across Greece in a winged chariot to teach Greeks (helped by Persephone) how to plant and harvest crops. Triptolemus is recorded as one of the first men to be taught the Eleusinian Mysteries by Demeter. In art he is depicted as a young man with a branch or diadem in his hair, usually sitting on his winged chariot, adorned with serpents. His attributes include a plate of grain, a pair of wheat or barley ears and a sceptre. He is sometimes said to be the son of GAIA and OCEANUS

TUATHA DÉ DANANN
Origin: Celtic Ireland
Sex: N
Category: Deity
Aliases: CHILDREN OF LIGHT, CHILDREN OF DON
A generic term for a Irish Celtic pantheon whose characteristics, individually and collectively, surface in one form or another right across the Celtic world. Ironically, most of what is known about them was preserved by early Irish Christian monks, who attempted to neutralise their influence by painting them as supernatural kings, queens and heroes from pre-Christian Ireland; either that, or fallen angels. As a people they were pitched aganist the FOMORIANS, a race of evil nature-deities, whom they beat at the Battle of Mag Tuired. Later medieval writers depicted the Tuatha as gods. Many living Irish people associate them with the 'little people' who live in an Otherworld accessible from stone monuments and ancient tombs. This encyclopaedia lists their attributes separately; see AENGUS, BELI, BRIGID, DAGDA (The), DANU, DIAN CECHT, GOIBNU, LUG or LUGH, MANANNÁN, MORRIGAN, NUADA

There are two gods of this name and there appears to be no connection between them. The Mesopotamian Tutu is worshipped in the time of Hammurabi (1810-1750BC) and the Egyptian deity in the late period of Egypt (664-332BC). The Mesopotamian version is the tutelary god of Borsippa, near Babylon, later eclipsed by NABU. The epic Enuma Elish describes him as a peace-maker, devising the spell by which the gods may be at rest' and that he is 'supreme among the gods' not one of them being his equal.  He 'silences weeping and gives joy to the sad'. The Egyptian version is a god of the common people and worshipped all over Egypt, though the only known temple dedicated specifically to him is in a town called Kellis. He appears in reliefs in other temples and is depicted as having the body of a striding winged lion with a human's head, and the heads of hawks and crocodiles emerging from his body. He is the son of NEITH and appears to have been given power over demons, guarding tombs, but later protecting sleepers from bad dreams. Offerings of goose and bread were made to him on portable altars. The Greeks named him TITHOES
