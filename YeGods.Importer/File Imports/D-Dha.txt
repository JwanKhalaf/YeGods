Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: DAEDALOS, DAIDALOS, TAITLE
Mythological inventor, architect (most notably of the Labyrinth on Crete, for King Minos) and sculptor. The name means ‘cunningly wrought’. He is said to have created many classical works - statues, temples - when no human artist or artisan’s name has survived. Daedalus and his son ICARUS fell into disfavour at the Cretan court and fled to Sicily after fitting themselves with feathered wings, and Icarus, flying too near the sun, melted the wax that held his feathers together and plunged to his death into the sea. The Athenians commandeered his ancestry from the Cretans, depicting him as the son of Metion and grandson of mythical king ERECHTHEUS, and constructing a legend which had him sent for to Crete to build the Labyrinth. The Etruscans knew him as TAITLE. His other son was IAPYX

DAGON
Origin: West Semitic
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: DAGAN
According to Ugaritic texts, Dagon is BAAL’s father. He is known as ‘Lord of the Gods’ and is first identified in the third millennium BC in Ebla in North Syria. He enjoys considerable respect in Mesopotamia under the Babylonians and Akkadians, with cult centres at Tuttul and Terqa both Bronze Age settlements in northern and eastern Syria respectively. He is a god of crop fertility - his name in Ugaritic means ‘grain’. The Ugaritic root dagan was misinterpreted by the Israelites as 'fish' which is why the god is sometimes represented with a fish tail. He is said to have invented the plough. As chief god of the Philistines, he was worshipped at the temple at Ras Shamra in Palestine and had sanctuaries at Beth-Dagon (Asher), at Gaza and at Ashdod. From 2500 to 1500BC he was second only in importance to EL, but after this his function as a crop and vegetation deity passed to Baal, and it might have been at this time that he became a chthonic, or underworld, deity

DANU
Origin: Vedic Hinduism, Celtic Wales/Ireland
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ANANN, ANU, DANA, DANAND, DONAND, DÔN
Danu is likely to have originated among the proto-Celts of central Europe, her name deriving most likely from the notional Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language. From the earliest times she is linked with flowing water and fertility, attributes most notable in Vedic Hinduism, though her name can be traced into several European rivers – the Don, Danube and Dneiper being three. In Ireland, she is the founder, progenitor and mother-goddess of the Irish pantheon, the TUATHA DÉ DANANN ('the people of the goddess Danu'). 'Dan' is Old Irish for 'knowledge'. Linguist Eric Hamp suggests a Proto-Indo-European word for 'good' as source. The Welsh knew her as DÔN, for whom she is likewise the progenitor of the Welsh pantheon. She is the goddess of the earth and plenty. In Welsh legend, she is daughter of MATHONWY and sister of MATH. She marries BELI, the god of death, and is the mother of AMATHON, ARANNRHOD, GILVAETHWY, GOVANNON, GWYDYON and NUDD. The Christian Saint Anne attracts some of her legends and attributes. In Vedic Hinduism Danu is one of Hinduism's primal deities. She is a personification of the primeval waters out of which creation arose. She is the mother of the demonic warrior VRTRA, who attacks and is defeated by the rain god INDRA. In later Hinduism she is the daughter of DAKSA and consort of KASYAPA

The Slavs' solar deity, son of chief god SVAROG and brother to the fire and post-solstice winter sun god SVARAZIC/SVAROZHICH, he is worshipped at harvest-time as SVENTOVIT. He is imagined as mounting a diamond sky-chariot from his eastern palace each morning as a young man, and dismounting in the evening as a dying old man. His attendants are two virgins, the morning and evening stars. His wise old counsellor is the moon, his seven judges the planets and his seven messengers the comets. He ages with the year and appears differently each season. He is represented by wooden statues: the one in Kiev has silver hair and a golden moustache. In Serbia, he is demoted to demon status. Some sources speculate that Dazbog and Svarozic, also a fire and war god, are just different names for the same deity, and that 'father' Svarog is a development of the extremely ancient proto-Indo-European sky deity DYEUS PHITER or PATER. Another school of thought has Dazbog representing daylight and fire in the sky (the sun) and Svarozic the deity of fiery war and forged metals on earth

Demeter is a mother- or earth-goddess whose precedents date back to the Bronze Age. It's assumed she has a connection with the ancient POTNIA ('of the Grain'), though this is recorded later simply as another of her epithets, or alternate names. Later mythmakers such as Homer and Hesiod fitted her Mycenian, Arcadian and Minoan heritage into the Greek pantheon: she becomes the daughter of CRONUS and RHEA and the mother of PERSEPHONE or KORE. She is the goddess responsible for the harvest and agriculture, but she is also the goddess who brings and maintains law and order and controls the cycle of life and death. The harvest theme, and the basis of the mystery cults attached to her name, is that a goddess mourns the loss of a loved one, who personifies the vegetation (usually the staples wheat and barley) that dies in autumn and winter. As her daughter Persephone (by ZEUS) is gathering flowers the earth opens and PLUTO/HADES captures her, driving her down into the underworld and marrying her. Her mother Demeter, in grief, retires to Eleusis and does not allow the crops to grow. Zeus, concerned that he and the gods will therefore receive no sacrifices, sends either HERMES or HECATE to oblige Pluto/Hades to deliver Demeter to her mother for two thirds of the year. He can keep her as Queen of the Underworld one third of the year, in autumn and winter. The Mycaenians had her (equinely-inclined) male companion as WANAX, another name for POSEIDON, and their and the Arcadians' myths persistently link her with this god of the sea – which in turn give her a link to the Minoans' Great Goddess CYBELE. Homer has her as a blonde goddess who sifts wheat from chaff. Hesiod has her parents as Cronus and Rhea, and has her luring IASION, son of ELEKTRA, away from a wedding feast for sex in a field; the resultant son is PLOUTUS. In the mystery cults she has a secret daughter, DESPOINA, 'the Mistress', who is horse-headed; in some stories Despoina is just another name for Demeter. The link here takes us back to Poseidon, who the Greeks detected in the froth of waves as sea-horses; Demeter is depicted as having a horse's head and carrying a dolphin in one hand and a dove in the other, symbolising her control of sea and air together. The myth of Demeter and Persephone is very similar to that of APHRODITE and ADONIS, which originated in Syria; the Phrygian story of CYBELE and ATTIS; Egypt’s ISIS and OSIRIS; and the Mesopotamian and Hittite/Hurrian legends of INANA and DUMUZI, HEBAT and TELEPINU. The Romans knew Demeter as CERES and her mother as PROSERPINE. A lover of Demeter is IASION, son of ELEKTRA. An ancient Greek festival, the Eleusinia, was held in her honour every two years, and has no connection with the Eleusinian mysteries. Her epithets give a picture of the powers and attributes she held: AGANIPPE or 'night-mare'; POLNIA, 'mistress'; Despoina, 'mistress of the house'; THESMOPHORUS, 'giver of customs'; ERINYS, 'implacable, retribution'; CHLOE, 'green shoot'; CHTHONIA, 'in or from the ground'; ANESIDORA, 'gifting from earth'; and EUROPA, 'broad-faced or broad-eyed'. Demeter was worshipped as AMPHIKTYONIS at Anthela in Thermopylae
