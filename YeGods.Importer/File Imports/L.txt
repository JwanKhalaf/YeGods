L is one of the Mayan 'Mam' or grandfather gods, usually depicted as aged, with jaguar ears, a broad feathered hat in which an owl resides, and a jaguar mantle or cape. He has an association with the moon goddess I, for whom he is probably the terrestrial counterpart, but he is also depicted as guardian of (or trader in) women. He is probably a patron of trade, of merchants and thereby of wealth in general. In the coastal village of Cacaxtla he is represented by maize stalks and cacao trees, both symbols of wealth. He is pictured smoking a cigar, usually a sign of black magic: the jaguar and owl suggest warfare and sorcery. It is possible he is one of the lords of the underworld

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: LAENUS, OCELUS VELLAUNUS
A god of healing worshipped mainly in eastern Gaul, where he is almost always identified with the Romans' MARS. Unusually, he is Lenus Mars, not Mars Lenus, though he occasionally appears as 'Mars Laenus'. He is the Treveri tribe's chief god, with medicinal springs at Trier and the Martberg by Pommern, both now in Germany. Two dedications to him are also known in south-western Britain, at Chedworth in Gloucestershire and Caerwent in Monmouthshire, Wales, where an inscription on the base of a statue links him to the deity OCELUS VELLAUNUS. The link with Mars identifies him as a warrior god, or god of warriors, even though his major worship sites are healing springs. At Trier Lenus's divine partners are ANCAMNA and the Roman VICTORIA, and the XULSIGIAE, probably water-nymphs. At Kaul in Luxembourg Lenus is linked with the Celtic deities VERAUDUNUS and INCIONA. The Treveri identified several other Celtic deities with Mars, and perhaps by extension with Lenus: they included IOVANTUCARUS, a protector of youth; INTARABUS; CAMULOS; and LOUCETIOS

LEUCOTHEA
Origin: Greek
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: LOSNA, INO, HALIA
The name is Greek for ‘White Goddess’ and it’s Leucothea’s story that inspired Robert Graves’s book of the same name. She originated as a sea goddess, possibly with the Etruscans (under the name LOSNA), and early legends have her as a nymph transformed into a goddess. She is synonymous with INO, sister of SEMELE and queen of Athamas. She became a goddess after HERA drove her insane as a punishment for caring for the new-born DIONYSUS. Ino/Leucothea leapt into the sea, with her son MELICERTES in her arms. Out of pity, the Hellenes asserted, the Olympian gods turned them both into sea-gods, transforming Melicertes into PALAEMON. In the version sited at RHODES, a much earlier mythic level can be detected. There, the woman who plunged into the sea and became Leucothea was HALIA (‘of the sea’), a local nymph and one of the aboriginal TELCHINES of the island, who succumbed to POSEIDON, nurtured on the island. Halia bore him Rhodos/Rhode and six sons; the sons were maddened by APHRODITE in retaliation for an impious affront, assaulted their sister and were confined beneath the Earth by Poseidon. Thus the Rhodians traced their mythic descent from Rhode and the titan HELIOS, according to Graves (1955). In the Odyssey Leucothea makes a dramatic appearance as a sea-mew who offers the shipwrecked Odysseus a veil to wind round himself to save his life in the sea. Homer makes her the transfiguration of INO

Absent from his body on a spiritual journey, a disciple cremated it, and Li Ning-Yang was grudgingly obliged to occupy the body of a strange-looking crippled beggar instead. Lao Tzŭ advised him to be content, and gave him a gold band for his unruly hair and an iron crutch for his limp. This gave him the title Li T'ieh-Kuai, with the Iron Crutch. The beggar had abnormally huge eyes: Li K'ung-mu means Li Hollow Eyes. He is credited with raising the dead, walking through fire, and finally vanishing to heaven as a dragon, disappearing in a puff of wind, or stepping onto a leaf and disappearing

LIBER
Origin: Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
God of fertility and growth, of Italian origin, whose festival, the Liberalia, is on March 17. Liber, ‘the free one’ or LIBER PATER Liber, ‘father of freedom’, is closely linked with Dionysus/Bacchus (post-186BCE) and possibly predates both. Liber Pater is also the domestic deity of ejaculation. There is a link with the African deity SHADRAPA. His festival was a celebration for young Romans who achieved manhood. His spouse is LIBERA

LIBERA
Origin: Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity

'Wife' or female manifestation of LIBER. She is the daughter of CERES or a younger form of that goddess, and is often associated with PROSERPINA, though under the name of LIBITINA. She is a star goddess, ASTERA, though of the underworld, the zodiac below the horizon. She is responsible for female ejaculation

LIBERALITAS
Origin: Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
Liberalitas is imagined as the Roman goddess of generosity, but she is more a concept or symbol – in this instance the Roman concept of just reward for loyalty to state - than a deity as such. Typically Liberalitas is portrayed holding either a tessera or an abacus and a cornucopia. A tessera was a tablet for recording the names of individuals who had received distributions or liberalites from the emperor. The abacus was a counting board. It was also suggested that the article in the right hand may be a scoop for distributing coins. Whichever of these three is correct, all are meant to exhibit the generosity of the emperor

LIBITINA
Origin: Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: LIBITINAS
The Roman goddess of funerals. Originally, perhaps, she was an earth goddess, patron of luxuriant nature and the sensual pleasures of life. Like most such goddesses, her dark side was a link with death and the underworld, and this side of her nature seems to have predominated. She is thought to have had a sacred grove in Rome, and her temple was where mortuary records and death registers were kept. She is sometimes confused with VENUS LUBENTIA (or LUBENTINA) an Italian goddess of gardens, and sould not be mistaken for LIBERTINA, goddess of lustfulness

LILITH
Origin: Ancient Near Eastern: Judaism
Sex: F
Category: Demon
Aliases: LILIT, LILU
The female principle, in Jewish folklore a demonic urge. The name means ‘night monster’. She probably began life in the Babylonian/Assyrian pantheon, where she was called LILIT or LILU. In rabbinic literature she is depicted either as ADAM’s first wife, who left him because she found Adam did not live up to her expectations, or his second wife after EVE left. By her, Adam - or in some versions, SATAN, to whom she was given by YAHWEH as his first wife - had demonic offspring. Three angels were engaged to persuade Lilith to return to Adam; her response was to curse all life and and specifically threaten great harm and evil to all children. She is known as a baby-killer, a harridan, the ‘night hag’ or ‘screech owl’. She is the mother of the LILIM or LILOT, is connected to the DJINN, and creator of succubi and incubi. It is speculated that Lilith is in fact Adam’s mother, the woman who knows him, who is his superior, and who introduces him to sex/mortality. Jews are recorded wearing amulets with the three angels’ names, as a means of fending off Lilith’s attentions, into the 7th century AD

In two inscriptions, at Aignay-le-Duc and Malain, Cote d'Or, France, she is invoked alongside the Gallo-Roman god MARS CICOLLUIS in a way which suggests she is his consort.

LOKI
Origin: Norse
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: LOKE
Loki is the son of the giants FÁRBAUTI and LAUFEY and foster-brother of ODIN. He is occasionally counted among the AESIR by virtue of his relation with Odin and the fact that many of his interactions are among the Aesir rather than the Vanir. He is, oddly, an attractive god but a creature of mischief and is described as the ‘contriver of all fraud’. He is punished for the murder of his brother BALDER by being imprisoned underground until the destruction of creation and the gods (Ragnarok). A serpent drips venom which is collected by Loki’s wife SIGYN. When she goes to empty the bowl, the venom drops on Loki’s face, causing him to writhe. These are earthquakes. He is likely to be the giantess THOKK (who refuses to weep for BALDER and thus prevents him from being rescued from Hel) in disguise; but he is a master of disguise and can be either male or female, in animal or human form. He is father (with ANGRBODA) to the monsters FENRIR, JORMUNGAND, HEL and SLEIPNIR

Loucetios is an ancient proto-Aryan deity brought into Europe, it appears, by people who settled in eastern Gaul: possibly part of the La Tene culture. He is particularly associated with the Vangiones, a Rhenish tribe, though inscriptions to him have been found as far afield as Bath and Angers, possibly indicating a Roman influence on his dissemination. The Romans identified him with MARS, but the Oscans in Italy saw him as associated with JUPITER. His companion is sometimes the Celtic goddess NEMETONA. The root of his name, 'Leuk-' indicates 'light', and his worshippers saw him as a deity of sudden light, thunder, of battle and storm

One of Tao's Eight Immortals, or Eight Genii. Lü Tung-pin’s story, unlike that of many of his companions, has specific details. His family name was Lü; his personal name Tung-pin; also Yen; and his pseudonym was Shun Yang Tzŭ. He was born in 798AD in Shansi to a family of officials. His height was 5ft 2ins. Whilst aged 20 an unmarried he met a fire-dragon who gave him a magic sword, with which he was able to hide himself in the sky. He became an expert swordsman. He met HAN CHUNG-LI who introduced him top alchemy and the elixir of life. One story says Lü Tung-pin dreamed his life history while Han Chung-li warmed some rice wine, and was thus convinced of the worthlessness of human dignity. He passed 10 temptations and, thus qualified, rid China of dragons, demons and other evils over more than 400 years. In 1115AD the Emperor Hui Tsung conferred on him the title of Hero of Marvellous Wisdom; and later he was proclaimed King-emperor and Strong Protector. He is often depicted with sword in one hand, fly-whisk in the other (the latter symbolising his ability to fly and walk on heaven's clouds). He carries a male child to symbolise his ability to confer fertility and fecundity
LUA

Soldiers sacrificed captured weapons to the goddess Lua, also known as Lua Mater. She is linked to the worship of SATURN via a prayer in which they are both quoted, but this does not imply they were ‘related’. The connection indicates Lua is a fertility deity, specifically of sowing, though this clashes with her name (‘lues’ means plague) and the suggestion that she is linked to destruction and barrenness. There is an indication she is the protectress of all things purified by and for rituals

LUCIFER
Origin: Roman, then Christianity
Sex: M
Category: Demon
Aliases: EOSPHOROS
Since medieval times, Lucifer has been regarded as a fallen angel and thus simplistically equated with Satan. The connotations and origins of both names do not merit this, since Lucifer is a Latin word meaning ‘light-bearer’ and a Roman astrological word for the Morning Star, the planet Venus. Lucifer was therefore a bringer of light/fire, similar to PROMETHEUS, and in Roman mythology was said to be the son of AURORA. Christian mythology has Lucifer a prominent archangel (or cherub, or seraph) in heaven, motivated by pride to rebel against God. Lucifer was then cast out of heaven with a third of the angelic host who had rebelled with him. He now resides on earth. In Isaiah 14:12 Lucifer is an honorific applied to a Babylonian king and referred to ‘heilelben-schahar’, two Babylonian/Canaanite gods, father and son, Helel and Shahar. Helel was god of the morning star and Shahar god of the dawn. In Isaiah, this title is specifically used, in a prophetic vision, to reference the king of Babylon’s pride and to illustrate his eventual fate by referencing mythological accounts of the planet Venus. Lucifer has been acknowledged by the Satanic Bible as one of the Four Crown Princes of Hell, particularly that of the East. Lord of the Air, Lucifer has been named ‘Bringer of light, The morning star, Intellectualism, Enlightenment’

LUCINA

LUCINA sat in front of ALCMENE’s house with clasped hands and crossed legs, thus preventing Alcmene’s child being born. Alcmene successfully appealed to the father Heracles to have Lucina removed, and Heracles lured her away. She was adopted into the Roman pantheon where, not unsurprisingly, she became a goddess of childbirth and midwifery, protecting the lives of women in labour. Her name may mean ‘she who brings children into light’, which links her directly with JUNO, but one source says the name may be derived from lucus (‘grove’) after a sacred grove of lotus trees on the Esquiline Hill in Rome, associated with the goddess. She is also linked with the Roman childbirth goddess CANDELIFERA and is sometimes perceived as an aspect of DIANA

Category: Deity

One of ancient Europe’s most popular and widespread gods, he is associated with crafts and music. The name means ‘lynx’ or, debatably, ‘light’. Caesar identified him with Mercury, largely because of his ubiquity; the Greeks saw him as Hermes or Apollo. These identifications serve to indicate Lugus’s importance in northern Europe. Irish tradition has him as Lug Lamfota, or Lug of the Long Arm, referring to the reach of his power and influence, or Lug Samildanach, Skilled in All The Arts, exactly how Caesar describes him. In this tradition, he is the sole survivor of triplets, all identically named. He is worshipped across Europe, from Spain to Switzerland, France to Britain, as a triple god. In Switzerland he turns up as the LUGOVES. In Ireland, Lug’s son or rebirth is the Ulster hero Co Chulainn. In Welsh tradition he is LLEU LLAW GYFFES, (‘Lleu of the Dexterous Hand’), whose mother is the virgin goddess ARANHROD, and whose brother is DYLAN. His protector is his uncle GWYDYON. His festival day throughout the Celtic world is Lughnasadh and falls somewhat arbitrarily on August 1

If Lytir is indeed cognate with Lodurr, he is one of the three gods who created the first humans, ASK and EMBLA. However, it's not certain. The name may be linked instead the the Old Icelandic for penis, 'litr', which would make him a phallic deity; or the Old Norse for either foretelling or blemish. If it's foretelling, there's a Swedish folk-story about a king who sends Lytir's ceremonial wagon to a sacred spot. Lytir climbs aboard and is brought back to the court, where the kings asks him questions
