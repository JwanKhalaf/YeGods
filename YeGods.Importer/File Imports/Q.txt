QUETZALCOATL
Origin: Meso-America
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: QUETZLCOATL, KETZLCOATL, TLAHUIZCALPANECUHTLI
A deity sacred to (in succession) the Nahua, Toltec, Aztec and Mayan peoples. The name means ‘precious-feathered serpent’. The worship of feathered serpents can be traced back to the Nahua-speaking peoples of the first century BC in Teotihuacan in central Mexico. In his early manifestation he was a vegetation god or an earth and water god closely linked with the rain, thunder and lightning god TLALOC. Scholars believe that in the Teotihuacan period he developed into one of a triad of deities. These were the un-named Goddess of the Cave, or Spider Woman, or Old Woman Goddess, who represented motherhood, reproduction and life; Tlaloc; and Quetzalcoatl, god of vegetational renewal. The feathered serpent icon gradually acquired humanoid features, but wasn't called Quetzalcoatl until about 600AD, after the fall of Teotihuacan. His worship centre in this period was at Cholula, also in Mexico. In Mayan areas his equivalents were KUKULKAN and GUCUMATZ (GUKUMATZ). Among Aztecs Quetzalcoatl was identified with the god of the wind EHECATL, with Venus, the dawn, merchants, arts, crafts and knowledge. Later, the Aztecs saw him as the creator of mankind. He became a patron of the Aztec priesthood, and of learning and knowledge. Following waves of immigration from the north of Nahua-speaking tribes (9-12th century AD) and their establishment of a capital and centre of worship at Tula, later the Toltec capital, he became priest-king, a god of war and human sacrifice, linked with worship of the stars and planets. He developed further as one of four sons of OMETECUHTLI and OMECIHUATL, sons together known as the TEZCATLIPOCAs. In this system, Quetzalcoatl becomes lord of the west, the White Tezcatlipoca, god of light, mercy and the winds (see also in this context HUITZILPOCHTLI). He is the god of the four elements, a representative both of good and of evil. In his guise as GUCUMATZ or GUKUMATZ he taught the Quiche-speaking Toltec of the Guatamalan highlands, and later the Mayans, the arts of civilisation – law, agriculture, fishing and medicine. He was said to be ocean-born, and returned to it under the banishment of his twin TEZCATLIPOCA. While Tezcatlipoca was known as the Black, Quetzalcoatl was known as the White Tezcatlipoca. He was also twinned with XOLOTL, who as Venus, the evening star, was the inventor of books, the calendar, the giver of maize, and a symbol of death and resurrection. His by-name is TLAHUIZCALPANECUHTLI, or 'Lord of the star of the dawn'. The virgin mother of both Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl is COATLICU. Other legends have him the son of XOCHIQUETZAL and MIXCOATL. By the time of the Aztecs (14-16th century AD) he had become patron of priests, inventor of the calendar and books, and protector of craftsmen, particularly goldsmiths. With his companion or twin XOLOTL, a dog-headed god, he is said to have descended into hell - Mictlan - to gather the bones of the ancient dead, which he doused in his own blood, giving life to the present race of humanity, products of a fifth and this time successful creation In another legend, his companion into the underworld and co-creator of the fifth world is CIHUACOATL. He is often at this stage depicted as a man with a beard (among a people lacking facial hair). His Aztec centres of worship were at Tenochtitlan - the capital - and Cholula on the Puebla plateau. At both sites his is depicted as the wind god and worshipped in round temples. He is thus closely linked with the wind god EHECATL, with whom in Aztec culture he later becomes synonymous. Among the people of the Yucatan peninsula he is known as KUKULKAN, where his chief centre of worship is the the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan, the modern town of Ouirigia

QUIRINUS
Origin: Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: KURRENUI
Originally a god of the Sabine people who became important as a deified emblem of the state, he was known to the Oscans as KURRENUI. His festival is the Quirinalia, celebrated on February 17. He is a major Roman deity ranking close to JUPITER and MARS - the flamines (flamen) of these gods constituted the three major priests at Rome. Both Mars and Quirinus presided over conflict and war, though as time went on, Mars became the patron of professional soldiers and Quirinus of conscripts or 'territorials'. Quirinus's name is in adjectival form and would seem to mean “he of the quirium,” a word generally taken to signify the very ancient Sabine settlement that united with the Palatine community to form the original Rome. It has also been derived, however, from covirium, meaning 'assembly of men.' That the Quirinal, traditional site of Sabine settlement, was the seat of his cult there is no doubt, and the Sabine origin of the god is reflected in Ovid (Fasti II, 475). In spite of his importance, little is known about Quirinus. Some believe Quirinus is only another form of Mars. By the late republic he is identified completely with Romulus. His was the name under which the immortalised Romulus was worshipped, and his festival fell on the same date that Romulus was said to have ascended to the gods, perhaps to assume the identity of Quirinus. His temple on the Quirinal was one of the oldest in Rome. A cult partner, HORA, is spoken of, as are minor deities, the VIRITES QUIRINI, of whom nothing else is known. JANUS appears with the epithet Quirinus, but the relationship between the two is a matter of conjecture. (based on Encyclopaedia Britannica)

QUIRITIS
Origin: Italy; Sabine, then Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
A Sabine (pre-Roman) goddess of motherhood. She was often associated with protection. In later years, Quiritis was identified with the goddess Juno, who was sometimes worshipped under the name Juno Quiritis (or Juno Curitis). Some scholars believe that Juno was in fact merely another version of Quiritis, although others say that the two are linked merely by borrowing. Her name is believed to have derived from a Sabine word meaning 'lance' or 'spear', and she is often depicted holding that weapon (presumably in defence of someone or something). This is a feature that was incorporated into Juno's identity. Traditionally, Roman marriages included a ritual where the bride's hair was cut or parted with a spear - some see this as the result of Juno's association with marriage, although other explanations for the ritual are given as well. Juno Quiritis is said to have been the only deity worshipped by all 30 of the original curiae (political and military divisions) established by Romulus. There was a temple to Juno Quiritis on the Campus Martius, an area where soldiers traditionally trained
