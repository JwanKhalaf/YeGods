The Italic goddess of cornfields. In a legend originating in the Augustan era, she was the wife of FAUSTULUS. Together they raised ROMULUS and REMUS the children of RHEA SILVIA, drawing the divine twins out of their basket which was floating on the Tiber.  She was said to have had 12 sons, with whom she made sacrifices once a year for the fertility of the fields.  When one of her sons died, Romulus took his place and instituted the collegium Fratres Arvales.  She is therefore identified with the DEA DIA of that collegium. On December 23 a parentatio was performed for her by the flamen Quirinalis, who acted in the role of Romulus (deified as Quirinus) performs funerary rites for his foster mother.  Acca  Larentia, or Larentina translates as 'Acca, mother of the Lares' , the Lares being ancient ancestral spirits dating back the the pre-Roman times of Latium. She is also identified with LARUNDA, MANA GENITA, and  MUTA. See LARES. Purely as Acca, she is associated with HERCULES/HERACLES, who is either her son or becomes one of her husbands.

ACCO
Origin: Greek
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
A goddess of evil, a threat to reproduction and child-nurturing. 'She Who Fashions'. She may have originated in Akkad, capital city of the Mesopotamian Semitic Akkadian empire of the the third millennium BC, where she was known as the Old Woman, the Grandmother, or the Midwife. She is the goddess who draws gods into being out of the primeval depths – an AQUARIUS prototype. It is unlikely that the Mayan god ACAT, watcher over foetuses and childbirth, has anything more than a coincidental relationship to her. It is more likely that her name is linked to a (now lost) proto-Indo-European root word meaning 'water', The Finnish/Sami cultures have Maderakka, Mother Water, the creatress of humanity. The Romans' ACCA LARENTINA  has a role a divine midwife, helping RHEA SILVIA give birth to ROMULUS and REMUS, founders of Rome. Like AKKA of Akkad, who fished Sargon out of the Tigris in his basket, she drew the Roman twins from a basket floating in the Tiber; and there is a parallel in the Biblical tale of the taking of Moses out of the rushes of the Nile

Achelous is usually depicted as a bull with the torso of a man and a bearded face (common for river gods, especially on coins), but also as an old, grey man with horns. (Ovid VIII, 547; IX, 1) His wife is the muse MELPOMENE and in one legend the SYRENS are his daughters. Achlae is his Etruscan name

Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: 	AKHILEOS, AKHILLEUS, PONTARCHUS			
The son of PELEUS, king of the Myrmidons of Thessaly, and the sea-nymph THETIS. He was worshipped at Leuke, Sparta, Elis and Sigeum. Achilles was the greatest of the Greek warriors in the Trojan War. When he was a child his mother dipped him into the River Styx to make him immortal. The waters made him invulnerable except for the heel by which his mother held him. Achilles fought many battles during the 10-year siege of Troy. When the Mycenaean king Agamemnon seized the captive maiden Briseis from him, Achilles withdrew the Myrmidons from battle and sulked in his tent. The Trojans, emboldened by his absence, attacked the Greeks and drove them into headlong retreat. Then Patroclus, Achilles’ friend and companion, begged Achilles to lend him his armour and let him lead the Myrmidons into battle. Achilles consented. When Patroclus was killed by the Trojan prince Hector, the grief-stricken Achilles returned to battle, slew Hector, and dragged his body in triumph behind his chariot. He later permitted Priam, king of Troy, to ransom Hector’s body. Achilles fought his last battle with Memnon, king of the Ethiopians. After killing the king, Achilles led the Greeks to the walls of Troy. There he was mortally wounded in the heel by Paris. The quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, the subsequent battle, and the ransoming of Hector's body are recounted in the Iliad. His name can be translated as ‘grief of the people’ In the Black Sea from Emperor Hadrian's time (117-138AD) onwards he was considered divine and worshipped as PONTARCHUS, ruler of the sea

ADAD
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer, Akkad,  Babylon
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: HADAD, RAMMAN, RIMMON	
The Syrian thunder god, god of the weather, whose worship was widespread, popular and protracted throughout the Middle East. The name itself may have been brought to Mesopotamia c. 2500BC by the Ugaritic Western Semites, who called him HADAD (King of Heaven). He is identified with the Sumerians’ ISHKUR. He is also known in later Akkadian culture as RAMMAN and thus to the contemporary writers of the Old Testament as RIMMON or RAMMAN the Thunderer. He is both a giver and destroyer of life. As ‘Lord of Abundance’ his rains gave grain, wine and food; but as a bringer of storms and hurricanes, he is the giver of darkness, famine and death. His power and influence was overtaken and absorbed by the later ENLIL and NINURTA, both storm deities, and to whom he became a mere assistant or companion. He is ENKI's twin brother, sometimes Enlil's son, and his consort is grain goddess SHALA. Some texts say he is the son of AN(U), the supreme heaven god,  others of the moon god SIN/NANNA by NINGAL. He is sometimes also said to be the brother of UTU/SHAMASH and INANNA/ISHTAR. Semitic tradition names his father as BEL, Lord of All Lands. His symbol is the cypress, his animals the bull, representing fecundity, and the lion, representing rage and power. He is sometimes depicted as having horns or a horned helmet, and he carries a spear or lightning bolt, sometimes a scimitar embellished with a panther head. His sacred number is 6. His consort is SHALASH, possibly a Hurrian name. In Babylon, Assyria and Aleppo (an important centre of Adad worship) he is known as the god of oracle and divination. He had a major cult centre at Baalbek in the Beqaa valley, Lebanon. He is identified with the Anatolian storm god TESHUB and AMURRU, tutelary god of the Amorites, and the Greeks equated him with JUPITER. He survives until 200BC. But see also ISHKUR

ADONIS
Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: GAUAS, AOS, ATUNIS					
Handsome and athletic son of the Syrian king THEIAS and his daughter SMYRNA (aka MYRRHA). His Syrian connections give him the alternative name of GAUAS or AOS. He is said to have come from Cyprus in some stories, born of the incestuous union of King Cinyras and his daughter. He was put in a chest by his consort APHRODITE and given to PERSEPHONE, who later refused to give him up. On appeal to ZEUS, it was decided he should spend a third of each year with Aphrodite, a third with Persephone and a third at Zeus’ own bidding. Widespread variations of this legend indicate persistent links with renewal rituals, and he is modelled, it appears, on the Mesopotamian dying vegetation god DUMUZI (later, TAMMUZ). Hesiod  makes him the son of PHOENIX and ALPHESIBOEA. One version has him the mortal lover of VENUS and PROSPERPINA, obliged to spend part of the year with Venus and part in the underworld with Proserpina. Women were said to mourn his death – killed by a boar whilst hunting – and rejoice in his resurrection at festivals called Adonia and held at Byblos and throughout Greece. He may have Phoenician origins: ‘Adon’ is Phoenician/Semitic for ‘lord’. Adonis is the equivalent of Tammuz (Babylon, Hebraic) and thus a protector of vegetation: the death/rebirth legends attached to the name of each are parallel, except that Tammuz is linked with ISHTAR, while Adonis is NOT linked with the equivalent ARTEMIS, but with APHRODITE. His Etruscan manifestation is ATUNIS. He is often depicted nude and carrying a lyre

The wife of ZETHUS, king of Thebes. She was insanely jealous of her sister-in-law, NIOBE, who had seven sons, while she had only one. Attempting to kill Niobe’s eldest boy, ITYLUS, Aëdon slew her own son by mistake. The god ZEUS turned her into a nightingale whose melancholy song is a lament for the boy. According to a later version of the story, Aëdon was called PROCNE. She and her sister, PHILOMELA, were the daughters of PANDION, the king of Athens. Procne married a Thracian hero named TEREUS and gave birth to a son, Itys. Tereus eventually conceived a passion for Philomela, raped her, and cut out her tongue so that she would be unable to betray him. However, Philomela revealed the crime to Procne by embroidering the course of events on a tapestry. To punish Tereus, Philomela and Procne killed Itylus and served his remains to Tereus in a stew. When Tereus discovered the truth, he took an axe and went in pursuit of the women, who implored the gods to help them. In response to their pleas, the gods transformed Procne into a nightingale and Philomela into a swallow. Tereus was changed into a hoopoe. In another version of the story the roles of the sisters are reversed so that it is Philomela who becomes a nightingale and Procne a swallow. This version was adopted by the Roman poets, and it is the one most frequently encountered in subsequent Western art and literature

In Norse mythology Ægir is a giant, one of the VANIR, and king and personification of the sea in all its moods. His father is MISTARBLINDI (mist-blind) or FORNJOTR and his brothers the fire-giant LOGI and the air and storm giant KARI. His wife (and sister) is RAN, with whom he has nine daughters, the ‘billow maidens’, each one named poetically after a type of wave. After THOR provided him with a giant brew-pot or kettle he made beer – the foam of which was likened to the foam of waves - for the gods, who would gather in winter at his home under the waves for parties, which he illuminated by pouring gold on the floor of his hall. The cups in which the beer was served would magically refill. Ægir is identified with GYMIR (‘Blinder’) and HLÉR who lived under the sea off the island of Hlesey. Gymir is the giant father of the beautiful GERDR wooed by FREYR. There may be a parallel between Gymir and the sea-giant HYMIR, said to be the father of TYR. Ægir had two servants, Fimafengr (killed by Loki) and Eldir. According to Sidonius, early Saxons made human sacrifices to a god of the sea, possibly connected with Aegir

AENEAS
Origin: Greek/Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
The son of ANCHISES, a Trojan prince, and VENUS, goddess of love, or APHRODITE, therefore technically a demigod. After the capture of Troy by the Greeks, Aeneas escaped from the fallen city with the help of his mother. Carrying his aged father on his back and leading his little son by the hand, Aeneas made his way to the coast. In the confusion of flight, his wife was left behind. A long, adventure-filled voyage took Aeneas to Thrace, Delos, Crete, and Sicily, where his father died. The goddess JUNO, who had always hated Aeneas and wanted to prevent him from founding Rome, which she knew to be his destiny, tried to drown him in a violent storm. He and his crew were cast up on the African coast, where they were welcomed by DIDO, the beautiful queen of Carthage. Dido fell in love with Aeneas and begged him to remain. When he refused and set sail, she took her own life in despair. After several years of wandering, Aeneas reached Italy and the mouth of the Tiber. There he was hospitably received by LATINUS, king of Latium. He became betrothed to LAVINIA, the daughter of Latinus, but before he could marry her, Juno caused TURNUS, king of the Rutuli and a rejected suitor of Lavinia, to make war against Aeneas and Latinus. The war was resolved by hand-to-hand combat, in which Turnus was defeated and slain by Aeneas.

Commander in chief of the forces that sailed against Troy to recapture HELEN. When the Greeks had assembled in Aulis for their voyage to Troy, they were held back by adverse winds. To calm the winds, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to the goddess ARTEMIS. His quarrel with Achilles over the captive princess Briseis and the consequences of that quarrel form much of the plot of Homer's Iliad. After a ten-year siege, Troy fell and Agamemnon returned in triumph to Mycenae. With him came the Trojan princess Cassandra, who had been awarded to him by the victorious Greek army. He was murdered in the bath by Clytemnestra with the help of her lover, AEGISTHUS. Elektra saved the life of Agamemnon’s son Orestes by sending him away. His death was avenged seven years later by Orestes. The story of Agamemnon’s death is told in the first play of the trilogy Oresteia by ancient Greek poet Aeschylus
