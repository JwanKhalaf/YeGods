KI
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumeria
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
Earth goddess Ki is Sumerian sky god AN's chief consort, though some records depict Ki and An as brother and sister. They are the offspring of ANSHAR ('Sky Pivot') and KISHAR ('Earth Pivot'), early personifications of heaven and earth. Insofar as An and the Babylonian ANU are synonymous, Ki and Anu produce a set of deities known as the ANUNNAKI (see appendix), chief of whom is ENLIL, god of the air. Legend has it that until Enlil's birth, heaven and earth were inseparable, and Enlil separated them. An's domain became heaven, and Ki and Enlil ruled earth. No cult centres or artefacts exist for Ki. Samuel Noah Kramer identifies Ki with the Sumerian mother-goddess NINHURSAG. Michael Jordan's Encyclopaedia of Gods (2002) says she develops into the Babylonian and Akkadian goddess ANTI, consort of the god AN(U), the Sumerian An

A minor aspect of INANNA/ISHTAR, Kilili is 'the woman at the window', 'the garlanded one'. The Sumerians called her ABA-SHUSHU, 'one who leans out of the window', and these names have led some scholars to think that Kilili may have been patron of prostitutes, since aspects of both Inanna and Ishtar have them as patrons of prostitutes and possibly prostitutes themselves. Another name for her is ABTA-GIGI, 'one who answers (or commands) from the window'. This is according to Johanna Stuckey

After Apsu is murdered, Kingu's mother establishes him as her consort, ruler of the gods and leader of her army against MARDUK. Then she too is slain by the jealous Marduk, now established as king of the gods. Tiamat had given her son the Three Tablets of Destiny, which he wore as a breastplate and gave him great power. Kingu flees when faced by the mighty Marduk, who captures and kills him, according to the Akkadian epic the Enuma Eliš. Marduk then mixes Kingu's blood with clay to form the first human beings; in other legends, it's the god ENKI or EA. After death, Kingu goes to live in the underworld kingdom of Ereshkigal with the other deities who had sided with Tiamat

Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: KIRIRISA, KIRRISI, KIRIRISA, KIRISA, KIRRISHA
After her husband and chief of the Elamite gods HUMBAN, Kiririsha was for a long time the most important deity in the country, supplanting Humban's first, northern, wife PINIKIR. Kiririsha, sky-god Humban and judge of souls INSHUSHINAK formed a premier triad. Kiririsha's Elamite name probably means 'great goddess' or 'great lady', 'mistress of the high temple'. She was initially known as the Lady of Lyan, a Persian Gulf port in SW Iran, modern Bushehr, a town of which she was the tutelary goddess with her husband Humban. Pinikir survived in the north, her worship centred on the city of Susa, but by about 1800BC the two goddesses had merged. Some researchers consider that Kiririsha was never more than an epithet for Pinikir. Kiririsha was a fertility goddess, often depicted squeezing her breasts and crouching in childbirth. She was venerated as giving life, health, and in her darker moments death and disease

Aliases: KRŠNA, BALAKRŠNA , BALAKRISHNA
‘The divine cowherd.’ the eighth of the 10 dasavataras (= ‘descents’, avatars or incarnations) of VISHNU. Sometimes elevated to the rank of a deity, in which instance his half-brother BALARAMA is seen as an avatara. Vishnu was persuaded to come down to earth as Krishna to prevent demons overcoming the gods. His birth and infancy – at which time he is known as BALAKRŠNA - is enhanced by stories of miraculous doings and his occupation, cowherd, signifies his relationship to Mother Earth, since cows are the living symbols of the Goddess. In the Mahabharata, he is an heroic rather than divine participant. A flute-player, seducer and king, he is seen as the ideal companion and friend to both men and women, his role to free the world from oppression. He is worshipped at the spring festival of Holi. He is most often depicted with a blue skin, representing the colour of the sea and sky, playing a flute to denote his early days as a cowherd, and standing on a lotus flower, symbol of purity and fertility

KUR
Origin: Mesopotamia

Like KI, Kur means 'land' and embodies the concept of territorial ownership: Sumer itself was 'Kur-gal' or the Great Land. But the reverse of this coin was that Kur was also the underworld, the void space between the primeval sea of ABZU/APSU and the Earth, MA. Adopted by the later Babylonians, Kur is possibly one of the ANUNNAKI, brother to ERESHKIGAL, INANNA, ENKI and ENLIL. In the Akkadian epic the Enuma Elish from the first millennium BC Kur has taken the form of a sinuous fire-spitting dragon, part of TIAMAT's retinue. In one story the slaying of Kur brings on a flood which drowns the earth. A depiction of Kur from this period suggests the dragon was subdued by a god, whose chariot he is pulling
