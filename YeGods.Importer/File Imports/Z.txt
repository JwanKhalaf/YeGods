The earthly Zanaharibe made clay figurines of men, women and animals but could not bring them to life.

He finally agreed to hand over the women if the heavenly Zanaharibe would give all his figurines life. The heavenly Zanaharibe did this, but at the last moment the earthly god reneged on the deal and held onto the women. The two gods fell out, and heaven and earth were separated

The Zangbèto concept is both singular and plural. As an individual, he is the spirit of ancestors, pre-existent before humanity. As a Vodoun force, its members act as guardians of the night, unofficial policemen who patrol the streets, tracking criminal activity – which includes witchcraft - and handing the perpetrators to the community for punishment. They are hidden under 'haystack' costumes for ceremonial purposes and Yoruba tradition insists that there is no human under the disguise, only a benevolent and watchful spirit – or sometimes, that the individual is present but possessed by the Zangbèto.

A generic term for the stars, having the sun as their mother and sometimes the moon as their father. The singular form is ŽVAIGŽDE. Early Latvian and Lithuanian observers did not distinguish between stars and planets. The name in Latvian and Lithuanian means 'star'. Zvaigznes Diena, or 'stars day', was a holiday and festival held on January 6 that, after Christianisation, became a day to celebrate the arrival of the Three Kings. The goddess AUSEKLIS has a symbol, the Ausekla zvaigzne, which means the 'star of Auseklis'. In his earliest manifestation, Zvaigznes is a god representing the gari, or spirits of the stars. Two of the most important 'stars' are in fact one: AUŠRINĖ, Venus of the dawn, and the other VAKARINĖ OR VAKARĖ, the evening Venus, who makes the bed for SAULÉ, the sun. Other stars, Ausrine's sisters, are sometimes mentioned in legend and they too are planets, not stars: ŽVAIGŽDES INDRAJA (Jupiter, INDRA in Hinduism), SĖLIJA (Saturn), ŽIEZDRĖ (Mars) and VAIVORA (Mercury)
