Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ERZULIE DANTÓ, EZILI DANTOR, IANSAN, OYA, OSHUN, CHAXIRAXI, PACHAMAMA, SANTA BARBARA AFRICANA
More than 500 statues and paintings of the Black Madonna can be found in European churches, with concentrations in France, Spain, Italy and Belgium, and further afield in the Americas and Philippines. Some scholars believe the apparent ‘black skin’ of such images arose accidentally, through the materials and pigments used (ageing); others that there is a religious significance, perhaps linked to legends that the Mother of Christ, or Mary Magdalene - the madonnas could represent either - was darker-skinned than her Palestinian contemporaries, perhaps Egyptian. The madonnas tend to be miraculous, and their sites tend to be visited by large numbers of pilgrims. Black madonnas have exerted cultural influences far wider than their own locations. Two examples: The Black Madonna of Czestochowa (Poland) is a warrior, the protector of women and children, and was transferred to Cuba by Polish workers, where she fused with ERZULIE. The cult of the Virgin of Candelaria, patron saint of the Canary Islands, was transferred to the Americas and the Caribbean, where she fused with that of the Yoruba goddesses IANSAN, OYA (Cuba) and OSHUN (Brazil). In the guanche mythology of the Canary Islands she fuses with CHAXIRAXI and her son CHIJORAJI

BRAHMA
Origin: Late Vedic Hinduism
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: PRAJAPATI, SAHAMPATI
Brahma is one of the three primal pre-Aryan gods in Hinduism, the TRIMURTI of Brahma, SHIVA and VISHNU. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer/renewer. Brahma was born from a golden egg, the ‘egg of the universe’, the shell cracking into two halves to form heaven and earth. He is depicted with four heads and four arms, with a yellow complexion, white garments, and garlanded. The Vedas, holy scriptures, are said to have sprung from his head. Brahma assumed the identity of his Vedic equivalent, PRAJAPATI. Feeling lonely, he created the female principle SATARUPA from his own body. She hid after he cut her loose, and the heads (looking in all directions) are to ensure she doesn’t slip away and hide ever again. He holds prayer beads, a water pot (indicating prosperity), a spoon, a string of pearls, a staff, an alms dish and a book and is often depicted riding on a swan or goose or - to indicate his non-createdness - sitting on a lotus leaf. A manifestation, Brahma SAHAMPATI, is said to have appeared to BUDDHA, urging him to pass on his teaching. Brahma’s consorts are SAVITRI, goddess of wisdom SARASVATI, the milkmaid GAYATRI or, in some sources, the goddess of speech VACH, by some accounts his own daughter, by whom he fathered the living world. After the Aryan invasions of the second millennium BC, Brahma became the ultimate source of all being, and therefore the bringer into being of the Rigvedas, a collection of ‘songs of knowledge’ of the Vedic people of central Asia that pre-date the settlement of India. If this is so, the Vedic/Aryans brought a multiplicity of deities into India, including AGNI, VARUNA and INDRA, a warrior/creator god who gave his name to both the religion and the country. Brahma's negative aspects – of drunkenness and duplicity – coupled with his incestuous behaviour, may account for the fact that he is less popular among Hindu worshippers than Vishnu or Shiva

BRAHMAN

The original Creator God, lord of all creatures, thought to be above and beyond worship. Hindus imagine Brahman as being the deity behind all others in a vast pantheon. Brahman is thought of as being Reality, the spirit breath, the Absolute, and has no gender. It is very likely that Brahman post-dates Brahma and is a back-construction. In early Hindu mythology he created three gods, the Trimurti - BRAHMA, VISHNU and SIVA, but in later mythologies he is described as having been created by Vishnu. Among his many descriptive names are PARAMESHVARA, PARAMATMA, BHAGAVAN, ISHVARA, and SAGUNA Brahman, the manifested divine presence, and NIRGUN Brahman, the supreme, universal and formless reality. His attributes and position in Hindu belief are interleaved with that of Brahma (see above)

Category: Deity
Aliases:BENDIGEIDFRAN
A Celtic god known more fully as Bran the Blessed. In Welsh tradition he is named BENDIGEIDFRAN. He was a giant, and known as ‘crowned king of this island’ (Britain). Legend says he - or rather, his head - is buried beneath the White Mount or Tower Hill, later the site of the Norman keep of the Tower of London. Bran died in Ireland, but when mortally wounded he told his followers to preserve his head as a talisman to keep Britain's foes at bay. Bran means ‘raven’: curiously, the legend of Bran's preservative powers have passed to the Tower’s ravens, which are said to protect Britain from invasion as long as they live in the Tower’s grounds. The raven colony has been on the site continuously since Norman times, and may be descendants of birds kept at a cult site to Bran. Bran is a relation of BELIN, one of the Celtic world’s most powerful gods. In Arthurian legend, he is revived as BRONS, a keeper of the Holy Grail

The patron goddess of the Northern British tribe the Brigantes. She is virtually indistinguishable from BRIGID. A stone relief at Birrens on the Sottish Antonine Wall links her with MINERVA and an altar at Corbridge, Norhumberland, calls her CAELISTIS Brigantia

BRIGID
Origin: Celtic
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: BRIGIT, BRIDGET, BRIGHID, BRID
A fertility and fire goddess whose feast day was February 1, Imbolc, known in the Scottish Highlands as St Bride’s Day, the day to celebrate the revival of spring vegetation. In Scotland she is Christianised as St Brigit or St Bride, and is depicted as midwife to the Virgin Mary. ‘Brigid’ means ‘High One’, and she is in Celtic tradition the goddess of arts, crafts, prophecy and divination, having this in common with MINERVA of the Romans and ATHENA of the Greeks. An earlier incarnation was as the mother goddess, in which role she appeared as virgin, mother and crone, and was depicted as having dozens or hundreds of breasts. In the Hebrides it was the custom to take a sheaf of oats, dress it to look like a woman, put it in a large basket and lay a wooden club nearby. Then the women of the house would cry ‘Briid is come, Briid is welcome’ three times. Variants exist throughout Wales, Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. In Ireland she is originally one of three goddesses, the daughters of DAGDA the Good God. As BRIGANTIA, she has an important connection with water, principally wells and springs, and is known as the ‘nymph goddess.’ Brigantia is the chief goddess of the Brigantes, a Celtic tribal confederacy of Northern England until about AD100, when she ‘emigrated’ to Ireland, later induced by the Catholic Church to metamorphose into St Brigid. Her principal centre is Kildare, where her sacred eternal fire burned. This was probably a pagan site

In the New Kingdom, 1569-1085BC, Bubastis became identified with the lioness of war, a woman with a cat’s head, but also a solar goddess said to be the daughter of the sun god RA and as such (as the Eye of Ra) an instrument of Ra’s vengeance. Sometimes her father is said to be AMUN. She is a wife of supreme god PTAH and mother of the lion-god MIHOS. She is linked with MUT and SEKHMET. She is depicted carrying a systrum, a primitive percussion instrument, in her right hand. She was carried into Greece, linked to ARTEMIS and her cult can be traced onwards to Italy - symbols of her worship have been found in many Roman cities

BUDDHA
Origin: Hinduism: Founder of Buddhism
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: GAUTAMA SIDDHARTHA
'Buddha' means 'the Awakened (or Enlightened) One'. Buddha himself was almost certainly a real person, born into a ruling Hindu family in southern Nepal, possibly in the town of Kapilavastu or Rummindei. The Buddha's name GAUTAMA SIDDHARTHA has two elements: Gautama relates to the clan to which the Buddha belonged, and Siddhartha means 'he who achieves his aim'. His father Suddhodana is described in the first Buddhist writings many years after the Buddha's death as a 'king' and his mother Maha Maya as a 'queen'. His wife was Yasodhara. Most traditions give his birth date in Kapilavastu as about 563BCE, though scholars dispute the date of his death, in Kusinagara, India, most now opting for 20 years either side of 400BCE. He is worshipped as a god by the majority of Buddhists, though neither he nor his followers claimed he was one; only that he and anyone who achieved enlightenment became above and beyond human-ness. He is said to have been born into a princely life of luxury. His immaculate conception, miraculous birth and signs interpreted immediately after suggested he would be either a ruler sage of global importance. His father tried to protect him from the realities of life. He is said to have married and to have had a son, but to have found his life wanting. He plunged into a life of severe asceticism but ultimately rejected this too as the way to enlightenment. His revelation was that all life is suffering, but that by a life of quiet faith and meditation there was a way past that suffering. He and his followers – he was an impressive missionary, travelling widely in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and southern Nepal - believed that the so-called 'Middle Way' called for adherents to remove themselves from the soul-destroying accretions of worldly life (karma) and the sorrow of living (dukkha), and to enter the enlightened oneness of all things (Nirvana): the extinction of the ego. Buddha never denied the Hindu pantheon. In Hinduism, Buddha is ninth of the 10 dasavataras (= ‘descents’ or incarnations ) of VISHNU. Theraveda Buddhism says there are eight Buddhas, of which Gautama was the seventh. There is one, MATREYA, still to come. Mayahana Buddhism, on the other hand, says there are as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand, but there is an Absolute Being, the DHARMAKAYA, the original Buddha or ADIBUDDHA. The Adibuddha has sent out five meditative buddhas or DHYANIBUDDHAS: the Great Buddha of the West AMITABHA (‘the one of immeasurable brilliance’), VAIROCARA (‘the radiant (or resplendent) one’), the Sage or Earth Buddha, whose position is at the all four points of the compass and is a preacher; the Great Buddha of the East, AKSHOBYA (‘the unshakeable (or imperturbable) one’), who is linked with SIVA, HERUCA and HEVAJRA in Hindu tradition, and with SAMVARA and FUDO in Japanese Buddhism; The Great Buddha of the South, RATHNASAMBHAVA (‘the one born of precious stones’), linked with gifts and giving; and the Great Buddha of the North, AMOGHASIDDHI (‘the one of unfailing strength’ (or infallible success)’), linked with saving and protecting
