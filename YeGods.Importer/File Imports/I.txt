The name simply means 'moon'. Iah is an early Egyptian deity (prior to the 16th century BC) who, by the time of the New Kingdom, was losing influence to the moon-gods THOTH and KHONSU. In the New Kingdom he continues to appear on amulets, looking very much like his rival Khonsu with lunar symbols on his head and wearing tight vestments. Iah-Dejhuty means 'god of the new moon' and is therefore an aspect of Thoth. Ian is also associated with OSIRIS, god of the dead, on the grounds that a new moon appears to 'resurrect'

In the context of Islam, an ilah is the concept of deity, a form which semantically includes Allah. But the first statement of the Shahadah ‘there is no ilah but Allah’ clarifies the position: ‘There is no god but Allah’, or ‘there is no god but the one God’. But see also IL and EL

INANNA
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: INANA
A mother-goddess, her areas of expertise being fertility, love and war, and in this respect she is synonymous with ANUNIT/ISHTAR. She is the daughter of sky-god AN(U), in some stories created by him as his consort; or ENLIL, or moon-god SIN/NANNA. She is the twin sister of netherworld goddess ERESHKIGAL – some argue she is the same goddess – and is the wife of DUMUZI and the mother of NERGAL and NINURTA. Her attendant is the goddess NINSHUBUR. In another strand of tradition her sisters are UTU and ISKUR. Precursing the very similar Ishtar/PERSEPHONE myths, she descends into the underworld KUR (name of a god and a place) hoping to impose her authority on her sister who rules there. She is admitted by gatekeeper NETI but obliged to remove one symbol of her power, or one item of clothing, at each of the seven gates. She is then killed and hung on a stake. The other gods, horrified, send two emissaries to revive and rescue her but in order to break the underworld demons' spell she must provide two substitute victims. She chooses her husband Dumuzi, whom she believes has been unfaithful to her in her absence, and GESHTINANNA. These two serve alternate periods of six months in the underworld. Inanna is depicted winged, in a horned headdress with a layered skirt, and with weapons-cases on her back. Her worship lasted at least 1,750 years (3500-1750BC) and during that time her attributes continued to change; one of the earliest representations of her is a bundle of reeds tied in three places. Later, she is a star or a rose, a lion-cub or lion, and is seen standing on a mountain-top. She may have merged as goddess of the date palm (consort Dumuzi was god of the date harvest) but soon became protector of wool, meat and grain and finally all of the natural world. She was a rain-goddess and of morning and evening stars, of lightning, of sorrow and joy, of retribution and fair trade

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: INDRAJA, SAKRA
The east Indian and Vedic god of storms, rain, battle and the air, in triad with SURYA (god of the sun and heaven) and AGNI (fire, earth). He is sometimes listed as one of the Vedic primal gods, the ADITYAS, whose mother was ADITI. In these early myths he is the supreme god, lord of thunder and lightning, who overcomes the powers of evil and brings the world into existence. He is depicted astride an elephant and is sometimes called ‘conqueror of the sun’. His consort is INDRANA or SACI and his children include JAYANTA, MIDHUSA, NILAMBARA, RBHUS and RSABHA. His epithet PARANJANYA or PARANYA ('thunderer') is thought by some scholars to be linguistically linked either to the Slavic thunder-god PERUN or the Hittite weather god TESHUB, further evidence of a pan-Eurasian proto-Indo-European language (PIE). He gave his name both to the religion and the country of India – via the 'Indus' Valley - but faded from significance in later Hinduism. In later eras his supremacy is supplanted by VISHNU and SHIVA, at which stage he becomes merely a weather god and ruler of even lesser deities, guardian of the east. In Buddhism he is one of eight dikpalas or guardians of compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, etc). In Jainism he is a minor master of heavens

INSHUSHINAK
Origin: Western Iran: Elam
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: NINSUSINAK, SUSINAK
The patron deity of the major city of Susa, Inshushinak grew in importance to become one of the major gods of the Elamite pantheon, a god of oaths and a judge of the dead. Technically his name is Sumerian, which suggests that the early history of Susa – a city with a culture and politics separate from the state of Elam originally – was influenced by Sumer. When Susa became Elam's capital, Inshushinak became a national god, after HUMBAN and his wife KIRIRISHA only in status. The Assyrians and other Akkadian-speaking peoples trimmed his name to Susinak. One source describes him as the consort of PINIKIR, a role usually ascribed to Humban. He lived where nobody could see him or his work, and when the Elamites conquered a tribe, the tribe’s gods were brought to Susa to be placed under Insushinak’s control

Sun god and the protector and ancestor of the Incas, being patron deity of Tahuantinsuyu, the ‘four united regions’ of the Inca empire whose corners met in modern-day Cusco, Peru. He has three manifestations, APO-Inti (Lord Sun), CORI-Inti (Sun's Son) and Inti-WAWQI (Sun-Brother). He is portrayed as a shining golden disc with a human face. The most common legend is that he is the son of VIRACOCHA, the god of civilisation, and is second only to Viracocha in Incan reverence as the Giver of Life. The Sapa Inca, the ruling dynasty, claim direct descent from Inti.  Inti’s wife is earth goddess PACHAMAMA and his sister is MAMA QUILLA, the moon goddess. Inti taught his son MANCO CAPAC and daughter MAMA OCLLO HUACO the arts of civilisation and ordered them to build the Inca capital where a divine golden wedge fell to earth. The Quechuas of the central Andes know him as Inti  Huayna Capac and, post-Christianisation, view him as the Holy Spirit and in trinity with God and CHRIST

ISHKUR
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases:  IŠKUR, NINHAR, NINGUBLA, ASULLUHE, ADAD, HADAD, RAMMAN, RIMMON
It's difficult to determine which of the Mesopotamian storm gods one should treat as the earliest or most significant; my choice of Ishkur rests on the number of threads that radiate out from his identity, and he thus sits at the nexus of a large number of aliases. Ishkur is the early Sumerian god of rains and spring thunderstorms. In storms he is a raging bull or heavenly lion-dragon; in his human form he often holds a lightning fork, thunderbolt or spear, and wears a horned helmet. Since his effects on the land, both for good and evil, are more evident in the north of Mesopotamia than the south (where irrigation rather than rainfall is more important for fertility), his worship was more widespread in the steppes and grassland of the north, and he was the tutelary god of the ancient city of Khakhuru or Karkara, probably modern Al-Jidr, 200km north of Baghdad and 100km south of Mosul in what is now northern Iraq. Another important centre was Aleppo in Syria. Khakhuru, it should be noted was also a worship centre for the sky-god AN(U). Some sources depict him as An(u)'s son. In the south, and in contemporary Sumerian times, he is the heavenly bull-god NINHAR or NINGUBLA, and in his bringer of rains and thunderstorms role also bears an uncanny resemblance to the Sumerian deity ASALLUHE and the Assyrians' NINURTA. In the early pantheons he is the son of the moon-god NANNA (in Akkad, SIN) and the goddess NINGAL, the brother of UTU/SHAMASH and INANNA/ISHTAR, and is occasionally described as either the twin brother or son of chief god ENLIL, and sometimes his assistant or companion, a service he also renders occasionally to Ninurta. His consort, both in early Sumerian and later Assyrian texts, is the grain goddess SHALA. In early texts Shala and Ishkur are the parents of fire-god GIBIL (Akkadian: GERRA)  In the Enuma Elis, supreme god ENKI distributes destinies and makes Ishkur the inspector of the cosmos. In the Akkadian period (2300BC – 2100BC) Ishkur is identified with, and slowly subsumed by, the Akkadian and Babylonian storm-god ADAD, whose byname is RAMMAN ('Thunderer') or RIMMON, the Aramaic version of the same name. Adad is identical to the north west Semitic (Amorite) storm-god HADAD, whose cult centre was at Ras Shamra, capital of Canaan, and whose mother is ASHERAH. Hadad in turn is identified with the Anatolian storm-god TESHUB. Just to confuse things even further, Adad/Ishtur is sometimes also identified with the Amorites' chief god AMURRU. In the middle Assyrian period, 1115-1077BC, there were temples to both An(u) and Ishkur/Adad at Khakhuru, and Assur, also in northern Iraq, which is a bit odd, since ASSUR/ASHUR is head of the Assyrian pantheon, the equivalent of the (southern) Babylonians' MARDUK. Ishkur/Adad is linked with the solar god SHAMASH principally because between them they controlled the weather and therefore the area's natural productivity

ISHME-KARAB
Origin:  Western Iran: Elam
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases:  IŠNIKARAP, ISHNIKARAB
Išnikarap is the original Elamite name of this goddess: Ishme-Karab is Akkadian and means 'she (who) has heard the prayer'. Elam repeatedly came under Akkadian influence, but it looks as though Ishme-Karab, despite her name, was entirely Elamite. As such, she supported the god INSUSHINAK in judging the dead, as did his other assistant, LAGAMAR, with Ishme-Karab acting as defence, Lagamar as prosecution. She may have been a goddess of oath-keeping; and she may also have been  male; so compare her with ISARA and MA’AT

ISHTAR  
Origin:  East Semitic: Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases:	IŠTAR, ANTU, ANTUM, ANUNITU, ANATUM, ATTE, ATHTAR, ILUMQUH, INANNA, INANA, HAGAR
The goddess of fertility, love, sex and war, her Sumerian equivalents are INANNA, INANA or KI. She is essentially the same goddess as the northwest Semitic/Aramean goddess ASTARTE. The daughter of NINURTA and the moon-god SIN, she was particularly worshipped in northern Mesopotamia, in the Assyrian cities of Nineveh, Ashur and Arbela. Her symbols include the lion and an eight-pointed star. She is consort of the heaven-god AN/ANU. As ATHTAR, she was a South Arabian equivalent of VENUS, and the Babylonians, particularly of Uruk, also saw her as the divine personification of that planet. As ANTU she was worshipped at least from 2000BC to 200BC, at which time, under Greek influence, she merges with HERA. In some texts she is referred to as HAGAR, meaning ‘stone’. Also known as in southern Arabia to the Sabaean tribes as ILUMQUH. She seems to be the equivalent of AGLIBOL, meaning ‘God Is Power’. Her lover is TAMMUZ, whom she wounds in the thigh - a way of saying castrated - and reserves the sole right to heal. In some legends she kills rather than castrates her lover.  In near-matching myths, both Ishtar and Inanna descend to the underworld. Ishtar sheds an item of clothing at each of the seven gates into the underworld, and arrives there naked. Inanna can return from the underworld only if she sends someone back to take her place – but each time she meets someone, she befriends them and refuses to send them back. When she arrives home, she finds her lover DUMUZI or DUMUZID (the Babylonian Tammuz) is not mourning her, so she sends him to the underworld. Dumuzi's sister GESHTINANNA is grief-stricken and volunteers to spend half the year in the underworld so DUMUZI can spend the other half on earth. Comparisons with the Greek/Roman ORPHEUS/PERSEPHONE legend are obvious

ISIS
Origin: Egypt
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ASET, ESET, AAT, MENKHET, HERT, AMENT, MENHET
The name means ‘throne’. The origins of the worship of Isis, the Heavenly Queen, are prior to the Pyramid Texts of 2350-2100BCE, by which time it is clear her place in legend is well established. In the Texts she mourns her dead husband (or brother) OSIRIS, reunites the pieces of his body dismembered by SET(H), and brings them back to life. She hides HORUS, her son, until he is old enough to wreak vengeance on Seth. The shelter she gives her son introduces a protecting element into the character of her worship, though it underlines her original role, that of mother-goddess.  Her names include Mistress of Magic, The Queen of Heaven (similar to Astarte), The Great Lady, the God-Mother, lady of Re-a-nefer; Isis-Nebuut, Lady of Sekhet; Lady of Besitet; Isis in Per Pakht, the Queen of Mesen; Isis of Ta-at-nehepet; Isis, dweller in Netru; Isis, Lady of Hebet; Isis in P-she-Hert; Isis, Lady of Khebt; Usert-Isis, Giver of Life, Lady of Abaton, Lady of Philae and Lady of the Countries of the South. In the mythology originating in Heliopolis, she is the daughter of GEB and NUT and sister-wife of Osiris. She is a great magician, more powerful even than the creator god ATUM. She protects the sick, and cares for the dead with NEPTHYS, NEITH and SELKET and from earliest times was known as one of the four great protector goddesses – BAST, Nepthys and HATHOR. In later times, Hathor and Isis become linked, and Isis adopts the astral symbol of  SOTHIS, or Sirius, the dog star. She is represented with the hieroglyph for a throne above her head, and sitting on a throne, or holding the child Horus, or in some instances kneeling before a coffin. The throne element made her a vital source of the Pharaohs’ power and authority.  She is occasionally depicted, like HATHOR, as having a cow’s head, or cow’s horns enclosing a sub disc, and occasionally, with a vulture incorporated in her crown. This bird in some illustrations becomes a kite, which hovers above the mummified body of Osiris.  Her ‘shorthand’ symbol is the ankh, or looped cross. At Akhmim in Egypt she is worshipped as the ‘mother’ of the fertility god MIN, but elsewhere in Egypt and Nubia her most common attributes are worshipped with consistency. Temples to her sprang up in Greek Alexandria, at Delos and Pompeii, though on home ground her most important sanctuaries were at Giza and Behbeit El-Hagar, shifting to Philae in the Late Period. In Alexandria she was worshipped as the patroness of seafarers. From here she conquered the Greek mainland and the Isis/Osiris mysteries developed, though in later times Isis’s identity became mixed with those of DEMETER and APHRODITE. Her worship lasted well into the Roman era, when her epithet was Stella Maris, or ‘star of the sea’, referring no doubt to the fact that her worship had been imported. Isidorus, in the 1st century BCE, declared that all foreign local names for any goddesses actually referred to Isis, (as does Apuleius later on). As Isis became the supreme goddess of heaven, earth, the underworld, and the sea (STELLA MARIS), her symbols became grain, poppies, the cornucopia, the zodiac, fish, crown, lions, ships, pine cones, and even a distinctive knot on her garment. The historian Apuleius notes that, at the temple to Isis at Cenchreae, the image of the goddess was veiled by curtains. Solmsen cites a reference by Tibullus to “painted panels” in temples of the Isis cult in Rome, presumably like those in the House of Mysteries and elsewhere at Pompeii.  In the origin myth of RA and the world, Isis found out Ra’s name by enchanting a poisonous snake to bite him. When Ra was close to dying, Isis told him that she could heal him only if she knew Ra’s true name. By knowing Ra’s name, she then had power equal to him and was then given all of her magical power and was forever known as the Divine Sorceress.  Isis and Nephyths were the divine mourners for the dead (Osiris). Isis was the one who retrieved and reassembled the body of Osiris after his murder and dismemberment by Set. In this way she took on the role of a goddess of the dead and funeral rites. Isis impregnated herself from the corpse and gave birth to Horus in secrecy at Khemmis in the Nile delta and hid the child from Set in the papyrus swamps. Horus later defeated Set and became the first ruler of a united Egypt. Isis, as mother of Horus, was by extension regarded as the mother and protectress of the Pharaohs. This relationship between Isis and Horus may also have influenced the Christian conception of the relationship between Mary and the infant Jesus Christ. There is a resemblance to the depiction of the seated Isis holding or suckling the child Horus and the seated Mary and the baby Jesus

ZEUS takes pity on him and invites him to the table of the gods in Olympus, where he blots his copybook again, lusting after Zeus's wife HERA. Zeus makes a cloud (NEPHELE) in the shape of Hera and Ixion couples with it. The product of this union is CENTAUROS (and the warrior-hero LAPITHES), who in turn couples with the Magnesian mares of Mount Pelion, who give birth to the race of Centaurs.
