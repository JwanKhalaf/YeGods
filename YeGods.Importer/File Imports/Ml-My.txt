MLACUCH
Origin: Etruscan
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: MLACUX
Since this goddess is known from a single recovered 5th century BC mirror-back, there is no certainty she is a goddess at all, merely a rather pretty maiden being carried off – or rescued – by HERKLE, the Etruscans' version of Hercules. The name basically means 'pleasant' or 'pleasing' though closely related Etruscan words suggest 'offering', particularly funereal ones, so Mlacuch may have underworld connections. She is probably the Etruscans’ equivalent of the Roman BONA DEA

Modimo is the supreme male being, creator and destroyer of all, with no ancestors.

MODRON 
Origin: Welsh
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
The name translates as ‘Divine Mother’ and in her singular and probably earliest form she is the goddess of motherhood, though she appears in other Celtic traditions as MATRONA. As such she is Latinised as one of the DEAS MATRES or MATRONAE, the familiar Celtic/Gaullic form of the triple-goddess, often depicted as three seated women holding, respectively, a loaf or wheatsheaf, a baby, and fruit, all of which indicate her origins as a fertility deity. In the Welsh hierarchy she is daughter of the god of the underworld ABALLACH, (Avalloc, Afallach et al) and mother of MABON (MAPONOS, god of youth, love, music and fertility). In her decline Modron became linked with a number of semi-historical figures (eg, Queen Madrun of Gwent) and is regarded as the prototype for MORGAN LE FAY in the Arthurian romances. There is also a semantic link with the Irish MORRIGAN

A Moira is any one of three goddesses with responsibility for determining human destiny, particularly the span of a person’s life and the amount of suffering it undergoes. Homer gives the Moira a singular identity and Olympic, godlike, attributes, to the point where the gods actually fear the Fates; but by Hesiod’s time (8th century BC) Moira is the Moirai, three old women, daughters of ZEUS and THEMIS. The first is CLOTHO (the Spinner) who creates the thread of human life. The second is LACHESIS (the Allotter) who dispenses and determines its length. The third is ATROPOS (the Inflexible) who holds a set of scales and cuts the thread. The Germanic equivalent is the NORNS

She is the handmaiden of Mother Earth, MAT ZEMLYA, and is the protectress of women's work, the sanctity of the household, childbirth and women's destiny.

In embroidery she is pictured as a woman with uplifted hands and flanked by two plough-horses. Occasionally she is shown with male sexual organs: she is also the deity of male sexual potency.

Their mother was the Titan MNEMOSYNE (Memory).

The supreme god of the Botswanan people, who express his/her will through cave-dwelling spirit mediums, usually female, known as the Voice of Mwari. He/she is a somewhat distant deity whose principal female attributes are as a god of fertility, seeds and rain-giving. She is the god of ‘below’; Mwari’s male attributes are a god of above - of the skies and light, and as the father of creation. He manifests himself as lightning or a shooting star. He has three manifestations: the Father, or SHOLOGULU, 'the big-headed one' or 'head of an elephant'; the Mother, known as BANYANCHABA, and the Son, known as LUNJI. He is in his own creation, but paradoxically distanced from it, in which circumstances his creation is called MUSIKAVANHU. The story of creation – in which Musikavanhu is Mwari’s agent, obeying his orders to dream and create a world - is curiously similar to the story of the Garden of Eden. Musikavanhu returns to heaven but his children disobey, think of themselves as gods, and corrupt the earth. Mwari’s attributes or aspects are named: DZIVAGURU (‘Great Pool’) is female darkness and mystery, but also the giver of water to her people, her symbols golden sunbirds (probably swallows); NYAMATENGA or NYADENGA (‘He Who Lives In His Own Heaven’) MUWANIKWA (‘He Who Was Found Already In Existence’) and sky god CHIKARA (‘The Beast’) are the principal ones. Chikara has a son, NOSENGA. Mwari also has praise names, the most popular of which are SHOKO, MBEDZI and DZIVA
