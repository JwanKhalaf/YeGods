XI WANG-MU
Origin: Chinese
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: HSI WANG-MU
One of China's most ancient deities, this goddess, first mentioned in an inscription from 1,300BC, lives in the legendary Kunlun Mountains of the far west – then later, the 'Jade Mountain'. Her name is often interpreted as 'Queen Mother of the West', but several scholars have said that Wang-mu would more accurately translate as 'grandmother' or spirit mother'. She is guardian of the immortal peach tree, which fruits once every 3,000 years and links heaven and earth. Her constellation is the Great Dipper. An immensely powerful goddess, Xi Wang-Mu – one of her titles The Primordial Ruler - governs creation and destruction, life and death (in effect, longevity), sickness and health. In the dao system she bestows immortality on seekers after truth. From earliest times she has been associated with the tiger, and is often depicted as having tiger's teeth and a leopard's tail – a possible indication she was originally a plague-protectress. Her sacred animal is the crane, though in some texts her animal is the tortoise, symbolising a dark warrior and/or winter and death. She is depicted sometimes as a phoenix, with its resurrectionary implications. A symbolic headdress seems to indicate a weaving device and represents her ability to 'weave' things into existence across the universe. She gives an immortal potion to the hero ARCHER YI but it is stolen by his wife CHANG E. When she takes it she changes into a toad and floats up to the moon, where she becomes the moon goddess

Also known as ICHPOCHTLI, meaning in classical Nahuatl 'Maiden', Xochiquetzal ('Flower (Precious or Quetzal) Feather') is a goddess associated with fertility, beauty and female sexual power. She is also the protector of pregnancy, childbirth, and young mothers and is the patron of crafts such as weaving and embroidery. Her Mayan equivalent is I, or GODDESS I. Unlike most other Aztec earth goddesses she is always pictured as a youthful and seductive young woman, richly-dressed, linked to vegetation and flowers, particularly the marigold. She represents desire, pleasure and excess, so is the patron of prostitution as well as of artisans who produce luxury goods. Her retinue is a colourful troop of birds and butterflies, and worshippers wore animal and flower masks at her festivals, which were held once every eight years. In Aztec mythology, her twin is XOCHIPILLI and her husband TLALOC – at least until TEZCATLIPOCA kidnapped her and she was forced to marry him. She is also married, in some legends and at different times, to CENTEOTL and XIUHTECUHTLI. By MICOATL she is the mother of QUETZALCOATL. In her form of Ichpochtli she represents beauty, sex, crafts, fertility, dance, music, singing, weaving, magic and love spells. She is also known as the Great Goddess or the Teotihuacan Spider Woman
