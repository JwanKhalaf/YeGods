Baal is one of the most ancient Middle Eastern deities, probably starting in about 1900BC as a storm and rain god and developing into a fertility and vegetation deity. Many communities worshipped Baal, imbuing him with a variety of characteristics and relatives. The Canaanites (modern Israel, Palestinian territories, Lebanon, W Jordan, W Syria/Ugarit) saw him as a fertility god and chief of their pantheon. Baal means ‘owner’, ‘lord/king’, ‘essence’ or ‘husband’. His title was Prince (baal-zbl), Lord of the Earth, or Lord of Rain and Dew. The Hebrews, who worshipped him until the ninth century BC, called him He Who Rides on the Clouds. He was said to have sired a bull calf from a heifer, a symbol of his fertility. This characteristic is referred to in two major incidents in the Bible - during the Israelites’ desert wanderings, when a calf was cast in gold, and when Elijah challenged Baal’s priests to a trial of faith on Mount Carmel (a bullock was consumed in the flames symbolically). He is painted as a villain in the Bible, but appears to have been a victim of a pro-Jehovah public relations campaign, since in other legends he is locked in mortal combat with MOT, god of death and sterility, a battle that results in seven-year cycles of drought/famine and plenty. He is killed in this conflict but rises again thanks to his sister ANAT. Many Biblical sites record the widespread Palestinian allegiance to Baal: a cult centre at Shechem gave him the name Baal-Berith or El-Berith, Lord of the Covenant, a fertility deity. Baal and El seem to be almost interchangeable in West Semitic culture. The Phoenicians called him Baal Shamen (Aramaic Baal Shamin), meaning Lord of the Heavens and pictured him as the son of DAGON/DAGAN: he is in turn father to seven storm gods (the biblical Old Testament 'Baalim') with seven midwife goddesses known as the SASURATUM. He had two daughters, PIDRAY of the mist and TALLAY of showers. In Phoenician cosmology, Baal won the title King of the Gods from YAM(M), the Phoenician sea-god. One legend has Baal successfully persuading ASHERAH to intercede with her husband EL/ILU, head of the pantheon, to authorise the construction of a palace. KOTHAR, god of arts and crafts, built it. El is identified with YAHWEH. In Syria El was the sun-god and his centre of worship was Emesa (Homs), where he was known as ELAH-GABAL. The home of storm god BAAL ZAPHON, ZEPHON or SAPON ('Lord of the North') was on the mountain Aqraa or Saphon in north Canaan. Baal was also worshipped in New Kingdom Egypt from about 1500BC, and entered classical Greek culture as BELOS, where he was identified with ZEUS and JUPITER. Baal was exported to the Punic culture where the Carthaginians knew his as SATURNUS, god of seed-sowing. Michael Jordan offers B. MALAGE, B. SAMIN and B. SAPON as separate entities linked to tutelary sites

The deification of the baboon, the name meaning 'baboon bull' or loosely, 'king of baboons'. From earliest times in Egypt (possibly c. 2700BC), baboons were considered to be deceased ancestors, the alpha males as deceased kings. Babi was therefore seen as an underworld deity, a bloodthirsty and aggressive god, eating the souls of those judged unworthy after they had been weighed against the concept of truth and order, Ma'at. Babi was considered the first-born son of OSIRIS, and, as baboons were considered to have high sex drives, he was responsible for the virility of the dead in their afterlife

He is identified with the Roman god of the vine, PATER LIBER, only after 186BC. The Bacchanalia, a mystery rite borrowed from the Hellenistic Dionysian rites, found its way into southern Italy about 300BC and was originally celebrated by women only, on three days a year. The festivals, later extended to include men and running five times a month, were little more than orgies of intoxication encouraged by Bacchus's entourage of female Bacchantes, nymphs, fauns and satyrs, the parts played by willing human participants. The Romans had his parents JUPITER and SEMELE. His wet-nurse was INO or LEUKOTHEA and as a youth he was cared for by the satyr SILENUS. His symbol at the Bacchanalia and Liberalia was a phallus, but he is often depicted as a youth wearing an ivy or vine crown and carrying a wand. He rides a chariot drawn by leopards

Some authors have apparently linked him to the horned god CERNUNNOS

BEL
Origin: Mesopotamian: Babylonian/Akkadian
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: BELOS, BELUS, ENLIL
Bel is a East Semitic title meaning 'Lord' and was applied to many Mesopotamian gods, though most often to MARDUK when found in Assyrian and neo-Babylonian texts. The word is cognate with North-West Semitic BA'AL and its Akkadian form is 'bēlu'. The feminine form, 'belit', means 'lady' or 'mistress', and is most often applied to Marduk's spouse SARPANIT. This form is further developed to 'belit-ili' as a title of Marduk's mother the Sumerian goddess NINHURSAG/DAMKINA/NINMAH, meaning 'lady of the gods'. Bel appears in Greek as 'belos' and in Latin as 'belus'. This god, originally one of the primary triad (with ANU - Sumerian AN - and EA - Sumerian ENKI) at the head of the Sumerian-Akkadian pantheon, was also called Lord of the Air. His Sumerian name is ENLIL. Enlil’s titles include Father of the Gods, King of Heaven and Earth, and King of All Lands. He is the god of winds, of agriculture and the inventor of the hoe. He was worshipped principally at Nippur. Under later Semitic influence, when Babylon became capital of the region, Enlil was worshipped as BEL. And eventually Enil/Bel’s attributes were transferred to MARDUK, the Bel of Babylon. In Assyria the chief god ASHUR assumed the name Bel, and Enlil’s attributes were transferred to him. Enlil’s consort was NINLIL, the Lady of heaven and earth, mother of gods, Lady of the lands, towns and houses. She became BELIT of Assyria, Ashur’s consort. The Greeks referred to BELOS but invariably meant Marduk of Babylon. There was another Bel: the god of Palmyra, in Syria, whose attributes include a lightning bolt and an eagle

One of the principal Celtic gods, he was worshipped throughout the territories occupied by Celtic peoples, from Asia Minor to Ireland (where he is known as BILE), from about 600BC into the Christian era. In Gaul he is a protector of horses. His name probably means 'Bright One' and, though the Celts are not known to have worshipped a sun god, he is clearly a god of light, heat and fire, and of healing. He is syncretised with APOLLO. His festival throughout the Celtic world was Beltane, May 1, as which cattle were purified by being driven between two bonfires before being let out into the fields. He is in many ways the equivalent of BELI/BELI MAWR

BELI
Origin: Celtic Wales
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: BELI MAWR
Beli is a father-god, the son of MYNOGEN and husband of the goddess DON, daughter of MATHONWY. He is credited with five sons – AMATHON, NUDD, GOVANNON, GWYDYON and GILVAETHWY - and two daughters, ARANRHOD and PENARRDUN. In the story of LLUD and LLEVELYS, Beli is named as the husband of LLYR, father of Llud, Llevelys, NYNMYAW and CASWALLON. At some stage these two strains of legend accommodate each other, with Beli’s children through Don becoming the Children of Light, and the children through Llyr becoming the Children of Darkness. Beli is a variation of the more ancient Celtic-Gallic god BELENUS and is a variant of the Celtic-Irish god BILE. In Arthurian legend, he is revived as Beli, son of Manogan (Mynogen), king of Britain and brother-in-law of the Virgin Mary. Among his relations is BRAN the Blessed, who makes an enchanted journey across the Atlantic (or Irish Sea), and whose head, buried on Tower Hill, London, protects the British Isles from invasion
