Aliases: NANNA, SU'EN, ENZU
Nanna is the Sumerians' moon-god, originally separate from the West Semitic moon-god Sin or Su'en, chief god of the Hadramawt people of southern Arabia, but blending with him in the Akkadian ascendancy (2334 – 2154BC). Nanna is the bull-riding son of ENLIL and NINLIL, and riding on a winged bull also becomes an aspect of depictions of Sin/Su'en, though Nanna appears to represent the full moon, and Sin the crescent. As astrology took hold in Mesopotamia, worship of Nanna/Sin spread widely (though centred on Ur in the south and Harran in the north) and the god rose in importance until be stood at the head of the pantheon in the 2600-2400BC period, described as 'chief of the gods' and creator of all things', and 'lord of wisdom'. The last Babylonian king, Nabonidus (556-539BC) tried to reinstate Sin at the head of the Babylonian pantheon. Sin's wife is NINGAL, the 'Great Lady'. She bore him the sun-god UTU/SHAMASH and INANNA/ISHTAR, goddess of the planet Venus. In his later years, Sin is represented as an inscrutably wise old man with a flowing beard and a four-horn headdress topped with a crescent moon. A corruption of his name is ENZU

SOBEK
Origin: Egypt
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: SEBEK, SOCHET, SOBK, SOBKI, SOKNOPAIS, (Gk) SUCHOS
The crocodile god, depicted with the body of a man and head of a crocodile. He is one of the most resilient of ancient Egyptian deities, recognised as powerful from the Old Kingdom (2686-2181BC) though to the Roman period (30BC to 350AD). According to the Book of the Dead, he 'dwells in water'. To a nation reliant on the Nile, the crocodile was to be feared and propitiated. Early in Egyptian history, awe of the crocodile’s power and savagery was personified in Sobek, to whom those who worked and travelled on the Nile prayed for safekeeping. In some myths, Sobek was the first to emerge from the waters of chaos to create the world, and as creator god was occasionally linked with the sun god RA. Not unnaturally, most of Sobek’s worship centres were where crocodiles were common on the Nile: thus, the early Sobek cult flourished at Al Fayyum, where one town, Arsinoe, became known to the Greeks as Crocodilopolis. Another major cult centre was at Kom Ombo, where the animals were fed and became quite tame. In death, these crocodiles were often mummified and buried in animal cemeteries, though elsewhere in Egypt, crocodiles were hunted and killed. Sobek came to symbolise the Nile’s produce and fertility, though the crocodile’s savagery was likened to the army’s strength, and thus he became patron of the military, in which role he is depicted with the symbol of royal authority, the uraeus. Some believed he was the repairer of evil rather than a force for good, and in this role he was regarded by some merely as an avatar of the primal deity AMUN. Thus, when Amun’s worship merged with that of RA (AMUN-RA), Sobek became Sobek-Ra. As an undoer of evil his is shown with an ankh. His connection with RA gave him another symbol, the sun-disc. In very late Egyptian mythology, Sobek is seen catching the four sons of HORUS in a net as they emerged from the Nile in a lotus flower

A mythical creature first used as the guardian to a tomb in Turkey in 9000BC.

The Greeks carried this idea forward with significant changes: their sphinx had a woman's head, a lion's haunches, the wings of a bird, and was a malevolent, treacherous, merciless monster who asked travellers a riddle and devoured them if they couldn’t answer. OEDIPUS finally answered the riddle and thus killed the Sphinx

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases:  SVANTOVIT, ŚWIETOWIT, ZUARASIC
Solar god pre-eminent after the 12th century and fall of RADOGAST-SVARAŽIČ. He was the tutelary god of the city of Radogast. Often depicted in statuary as having four heads, possibly because his attributes were those of four less major deities which his worship absorbed. He may be the god SVETOVID, worshipped at a temple on the island of Rügen: Svantovit certainly was. Svantovit was also worshipped on the cape of Arkona. He is a late West Slavic version of PERUN or JARILO. Evidence of his universality crops up all over the Slavic world and his specialities include divination, victory in war, protection of the harvest, and commerce. He rides a white horse, unlike his opposite, the three-headed TRIGLAV, who rides a black horse. He is worshipped by the Warsaw-based neo-pagan Polish Native Church as the highest god ŚWIETOWIT

Proposed as the deity of fiery war and forged metals on earth (see SVAROG). His name is the diminutive of SVAROG, father-god of the Slavic pantheon, and he is described in one document as Svarog's son. For a debate on the relationship between Svarog, Svarožič and Dažbog see below. Svarožič may be related to the Norse SURT

SVAROG
Origin: Slavic
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: SWARÓG
The commonly-accepted father of the chief Slavic deities, he is linked with HEPHAESTUS and seems to have originated with the East Slav group, the Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian tribes. He is a sky and fire god with two sons, (see SVAROŽIČ) who represented fire on earth, and DAŽBOG, who represented fire in the sky and was associated with the sun. Svarog is said to have forged the sun and have given it to his son Dazbog to carry it across the sky. The interelationship of these three is uncertain. Svarog is known only from the Hypatian Codex, a 15th century Slavic translation of a 6th century compilation of Russian monastery documents, in which he is described as the father of solar deity Dahzbog. Other sources speculate that Dazbog and Svarozic, also a fire and war god, are just different names for the same deity, and that 'father' Svarog is a development of the extremely ancient proto-Indo-European sky deity DYEUS PHITER or PATER. Another school of thought has Dazbog representing daylight and fire in the sky (the sun) and Svarozic the deity of fiery war and forged metals on earth

They were born of AMUNOS and MAGOS, who themselves were fathered by the TITANS. Sydyk is also credited with inventing the ship, which might give him Phoenician connections. There is also a suggestion Sydyk is linked to the Assyro-Babylonian god KITTU, and one of the reasons this connection has been made is that Kittu is paired with MISHARU, whose name is cognate with Mesor
