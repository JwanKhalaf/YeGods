Origin: Greek, then Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: HYGIEA, HYGEIA, HYGIA, HYGEA, PAEONIA
An independent deity before the 4th century BC, she then became one of five daughters of the god of medicine, ASCLEPIUS, and EPIONE, she is the personification of health, cleanliness and sanitation. She and her four sisters are facets of APOLLO's skills, and while she plays an important part in her father's cult, she is concerned less with direct healing than with the prevention of sickness and the continuation of good health. Her cult importance can be traced back to 7th century BC city-state of Athens, though she had temples in Epidaurus, Corinth, Kos, Pergamon and Paros. In Piraeus and Oropos she is known as Paeonia. She is often depicted as a young woman feeding a large snake that is wrapped around her body, or drinking from a jar she is carrying. Statues of Hygieia, none of which have apparently survived, seem to have been decorated with hanks of women's hair and with 'Babylonian' clothes. She transferred to Rome initially as the Roman goddess of personal health, VALETUDO, but became identified with the ancient Italian goddess of social welfare, SALUS. One of the cult titles given to ATHENA was A. Hygieia. Her attributes were recognised by followers of the Gallic healing goddess SIRONA, adopted into the Gallo-Roman pantheon. Hygieia's brother is TELESPHORUS. See also PANACEA, IASO, ACESO and AGLAEA/AEGLE, sisters of Hygieia. Panacea the goddess of universal remedy, IASO the goddess of recuperation from illness, ACESO the goddess of the healing process, and AGLAEA/AEGLE, the goddess of beauty, splendour, glory, magnificence and adornment
