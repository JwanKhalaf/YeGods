He presents gifts to ENLIL and is often described as Enlil's (warrior) son, which makes Nininsinna Enlil's daughter-in-law and moon-god SIN his brother. In one story he is AN(U)'s son. The tutelary god of the city of Isin and the lost city of Larak, he has the epithet 'wild bull with the multicoloured legs' and is represented in the constellation Sagittarius.

He was born from the sacred mantra (syllable hri), which fell from the heart of AMITABHA into a lotus flower floating over the waters of Danakosha Lake. Adopted by the royal family, he thus became heir to the kingdom of Oddiyana (the Swat Valley, Afghanistan) with the name PEMA GYALPO. A missionary of Buddhism in India, Nepal and Bhutan, he is credited with many miracles and the defeat of demons, thus winning many to the faith. After founding the monastery at Samye, he left for the land of demons and established an eternal kingdom there called the Pure Land, or the Glorious Copper Mountain. He is depicted as a pale-faced, moustachio'd young man seated on a lotus comprising the sun and moon. He wears three robes of red, white and blue. In his right hand is a Vajra, in his left a skull-cup with the nectar of immortality. In some images he wears a staff adorned with human heads and skulls (from Dr D Torre)

It is common for Daoist deities to have legendary mortal origins. Pak Tai is said to have lived in the third millennium BC, when he was thought to have devised innovative flood control and land drainage measures and to have sought enlightenment in a southern range of mountains. By 1368BC, the start of the Ming Dynasty, he was one of four saintly guardians of universal Daoism, and rose over the next 300 years to become Daoism's most important deity. His history of water-control made him a water-deity, popular in water-conscious Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand. As Xuanwu he was ordered by the celestials to conquer the demon-infested north of China, those demons represented by a tortoise and a snake (allegedly his own entrails, which he attempted to clean in a river . . .). This conquest earned him the soubriquets of the Perfected or Dark Warrior, or the Barefoot Emperor of the North. He is depicted in many temples as a seated, barefoot, sword-carrying warrior, his long hair loose and haloed, feet resting on a tortoise and a snake, symbols of the north

PALES
Origin: Roman
Sex: M, F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
God, or goddess, of shepherds, flocks and livestock. The name could actually refer to a pair of deities, one male and one female, since the Latin name can be used as a plural. His/her festival is the Palilia on April 21, a day on which cattle were driven through bonfires, reminiscent of the Celtic festival of Beltane. I have another, more detailed and different version: three bundles of the herb beanstraw are sprinkled with sulphur, incense and sheep’s blood, set on fire and leaped over three times. Another festival to Pales, apparently dedicated ‘to the two Pales’ (Palibus duobus) was held on July 7. Marcus Atilius Regulus built a temple to Pales in Rome following his victory over the Salentini in 267BC. It is generally thought to have been located on the Palatine Hill, but, being a victory monument, it may have been located on the route of the triumphal procession, either on the Campus Martius or the Aventine Hill. A ‘Pales of the alleyways’ is mentioned in Rome; it’s not sure if this is another aspect of the deity, or a separate entity

PAN
Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases:
A nature deity from his humble and ancient beginnings in the primitive mountainous region of Arcadia, Pan is named by some as a son of CRONOS, by others as a son of ZEUS, (and twin of ARKAS) but in many more stories as the son of HERMES, sometimes with the nymph DRYOPE. His name derives from pa-on, the Greek for herdsman and he is the patron of shepherds, flocks and pastures. He closely resembles PROTOGONUS/PHANES. The Roman counterpart to Pan is FAUNUS, another version of his name, which is Indo-European. Like other nature spirits, Pan appears to be older than the Olympian pantheon, giving ARTEMIS her hunting dogs and teaching the secret of prophecy to APOLLO. Pan is sometimes depicted as being a generic: his multiples are the PANES, or PANISKOI (according to Aeschylus in Rhesus), and the ‘little Pans’ played the part of satyrs. Pan inspired fear (panic) in lonely places, but was later known for his music, capable of arousing inspiration, sexuality, or panic, depending on his intentions

Other less common appellations include PERHTA-BABA, ZIOBNA, PEHTA SAMPA, STAMPA, PUBELFRAU, LUTZL, ZAMPERIN, ZAMPERMUATTA and RAUWEIB. It's likely the name means 'bright one' and she appears as a kind of dazzling snow maiden – though another manifestation is a bright-eyed, shabbily-dressed old woman. She appears to be a close relative of the Germanic goddess HOLDA, since both oversee spinning, are the guardians of beasts, and manifest themselves during the 12 days of Christmas. Perchta rewards good children with presents and punishes bad (especially untruthful) children with disembowelling

With her mother Demeter, the Earth Mother, she - the Corn Daughter - is subject of the Andania Mysteries, a Hellenistic Greek cult relying on initiation rite and dramatic ceremony, and the better-known Eleusinian Mysteries. Another name for her is KORE, 'the Maiden' – and another name for Kore is PRAXIDIKE.

The supreme god of the Slavic pantheon, though a son of the Baltic chief god DIEVAS. Variations of his name appear not just among Slavic peoples, but across Scandinavia and through Asia into India, indicating that he is a proto-Indo-European product. His sky god powers - as the 'Sky Smith', a maker of weapons and jewellery in the sky - are demonstrated by thunder and lightning, though he is depicted as the god of order and of soldiers. He is also a fertility god in the sense that in spring he attacks and purges the accumulated evil in the soil with spring rains and lightning. He is always accompanied by VELES/VOLOS, deity of chaos, and the relationship seems to be similar to that between God and the Devil in Christian theology: Perun occupies the high places, either a mountain-top or the sky, and VELES/VOLOS the dark valleys or underground. In Slavic lands, Perun appears in triad with KHORS and MOKOSH. In appearance and characteristic he is unca.nnily like THOR: he is red-bearded and rides the sky in a chariot pulled by a gigantic billy-goat. He carries an axe, the equivalent of Thor's hammer, which returns to him after he has thrown it. He throws thunderbolts, sometimes depicted as arrows, which can smash stones. After the arrival of Christianity, he is often retained as the prophet Elijah or St Michael, whose habits of the conquest of evil and the driving out of the Devil are identical. In Prussia he appears as PERKONIS (the Old Prussian for 'thunder' is 'percunis'), in Latvia as PERKONS, in Lithuania as PERKŪNAS or DIVIRIKS ('leader of the gods'), in Russian and Czech lands as Perun, in Bulgaria as PERUSAN, in Slovakia as PEROM (the word here means 'Curse'), and elsewhere as PIKKER, PERON, PIORUN and PYERUN. He is probably cognate with PARANJANYA (or PARJANYA), a thunder-epithet of the Hindu storm-god INDRA. Outside the Baltic language group it's probably Perun who is PYARUN to the Belorussians, PIRVA to the Hittites, PERËNDI to the Albanians, and Περχων (PERCHON) to the Thracians. Outside of the Indo-European languages, there is Mordovian PUR'GINE-PAZA and Finnish and Lappish PERKELE. There may be links too with the Icelandic FJORGYN, a name of mother of the Thunderer, and Germanic (but Latinised) FERGUNNA. In the Lithuanian tradition, Perun's wife is PERKŪNAITĖLĖ or PERKUNATELE
