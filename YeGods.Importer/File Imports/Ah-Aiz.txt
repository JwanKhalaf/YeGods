AHRIMAN
Origin: Zoroastrianism: Persia
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases:	AHRA MAINYU	, ANGRA MAINYU, ANGRU MAINYU, ARIMANIUS
From the third century AD, in Gnostic and occult cosmology, and to this day in Parsee India, Ahriman is the supreme God of the World, pitched against AHURA MAZDA (ORMAZD, ORMIZD, ORMUZD; in India, SPENTA MAINYU) and his lieutenant MITHRA in the ongoing battle of spirit against matter, light against darkness. His equivalent in Western cosmology is SATAN. In India, he is epitomised as the Lie, Darkness and Death. In early Zoroastrianism, Angra Mainyu slowly evolves as an entity; he is first depicted as the 'destructive spirit/mind', pitched against the concept of the 'bounteous spirit/mind' named Spenta Mainyu, both of whom are part of Ahura Mazda, the Lord of Light. Ahriman is said to have tried to persuade animals (the scorpion, snake and ant, for instance) to drink the blood of the bull slain by Mithras; had he succeeded, no life would have developed on earth. He is also said to have sent a flood to destroy the earth, a move thwarted by Mithras. In Roman times he becomes Arimanius

AHURA MAZDA
Origin: Zoroastrianism: Persia
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases:	AHURAMAZDA, HORMAZD, OHRMAZD, URMAZD, ORMAZD				
Ahura Mazda - Avestan for ‘Lord Wisdom’, ‘Wise Lord’ or ‘Lord of Light/Enlightenment’ - is the supreme god in Iranian religion, though he was depicted from the third century AD in Gnostic developments as being the twin son, with AHRIMAN, of ZURVAN (‘Time’). The concept was developed specifically by Zoroaster and later Mazdaists. Ahura Mazda created and maintains the cosmic order, demands ethical and ritual purity, and judges human souls after death. His first act of creation was to bring into being the twin spirits SPENTA MAINYU (representing truth, light and life) and ANGRA MAINYU (representing the lie, darkness and death). The world’s spiritual history comprises a struggle between the two. In later developments, Ahura Mazda is depicted as being the beneficent spirit in direct opposition to the evil one, there being no higher authority or referee in the cosmic struggle. Mithraism became popular in the Roman world, perhaps more in the East than the West, and there he is the deity of the military, though his inscriptions and depictions are few and far between. In the Roman Mithraeum he is assumed to appear, un-named, as the reclining figure being attended by Mithras. In Hinduism, his equivalent is VARUNA. He is also known as AHURAMAZDA (Old Persian or Achaemenid period), HORMAZD (Parthian period) and OHRMAZD (Sassanian era). URMAZD and ORMAZD and variations on this
