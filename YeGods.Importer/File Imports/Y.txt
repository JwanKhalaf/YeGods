YAHWEH 			
Origin: Canaanite/Hebrew, Judeo-Christian
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ADONAI, ADUNAY, JHWH, JAHWEH, JEHOVAH, JEHOVA, IAO, IAW, YAHO, ALPHA AND OMEGA
The name allegedly means ‘I am’, the assumption being that Yahweh was pre-existent, the first and creator of all. Yahweh heads the second earliest known monotheistic religion, the first being that of AMON (AMUN) in the Egyptian cosmology. The name itself is an assembly of four Hebrew consonants deliberately designed to be unpronounceable, because the name of God was too holy to be spoken by ordinary man. In the Canaanite pantheon, which pre-dates the Hebraic, Yahweh is just one of the 70 sons of EL (ILU) by his consort ASHERAH, 'Queen of Heaven', El being also known as 'father of Man', 'Creator' or 'Creator of Creation'. In the Bible, Yahweh becomes the chief god, a jealous deity much in favour of repressing all others, including BAAL, EL and other conflictual Canaanite deities. Yet Yahweh is also known in the Old Testament as ELOHIM, a plural term meaning 'sons of El'. In this guise, Yahweh's consort until the third century BC is ASHERAH and worshipped as such by Yahwists. Some theologians detect a direct connection between the Christian Mary ('mother of God', 'Queen of Heaven') and Asherah. Some scholars have linked the primitive forms IAO, IAW and YAHO to Jahweh, via the Greek sun-god HELIOS

His older sister is YAMI. SHANI DEV is apparently his step-brother, whose planet is Saturn. The Vedas say Yama was the first mortal to die, at which point he was put in charge of the deadand some scholars consider Yama and Yami to be the YAMUNA. and the underworld. He has a moralistic approach to the dead, judging them by the way they have mistreated others. Two four-eyed dogs guard the road to the underworld and run errands for him. YAMA entered Buddhism in East and South-East Asia and Sri Lanka as DHARMAPALA or DHARMARAJA, wrathful judge of the dead, and he is known in every country where Buddhism is practised. He is depicted as having four arms, protruding fangs and is surrounded by a garland of flames. He rides a water-buffalo. His planet is Pluto. The Nurostanis of the Hindu Kush, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Kalash people of NW Pakistan know him as IMRA, IMRO or IMR'O, where he is their creator-god.
