A goddess who cuts off her own head to feed blood to her devotees. She is one of the more ferocious of the 10 tantric goddesses the Mahavidyas, aspects of DEVI, the Hindu Divine Mother.

Three jets of blood spurt from her neck and are being drunk by her own head and by two attendants. Worship of her is quite rare, since she is viewed as dangerous to approach: she is popular only with tantrikas, yogis and world-renouncers of both Hindu and Buddhist persuasions. Chinnamasta is associated with the concept of self-sacrifice and the awakening of the spiritual energy of the kundalini, the serpent of life coiled inside every human being. She can be seen either as a symbol of sexual self-control or the embodiment of sexual energy. As an aspect of Devi she is both a life-giver and a life-taker.

Chthonia sometimes occurs as an adjective attached to Demeter’s name. At Hermione and Sparta there were festivals in which a cow was ritually slaughtered by three old women. The cow may have represented the spirit of vegetation. Another Chthonia was the daughter of ERECHTHEUS, king of Athens, and his wife PRAXITHEA; and a third, with her six sisters, the ALCYONIDES, were changed into birds as they threw themselves off a cliff in a suicide attempt inspired by grief after the death of their father, the giant ALCYONEUS

God of grain storage, the earth and crops, whose altar lies below ground and is uncovered three times a year for sacrifices. His festivals are the Consualia of August 21 and December 12 and 15. An ancient Oscan deity worshipped as CONSUI, he is the cult partner of OPS. His name was derived from condere (“to store away”), and he was probably god of the storage bin. He had a temple on the Aventine in Rome. On his festival days horses and mules were crowned with garlands and were given rest from work. On August 21, the festival of the Consualia, the flamen Quirinalis (the priest of the god Quirinus) offered sacrifice and the pontifices presided at horse and chariot races, in which mules took the place of horses. He also had festivals on December 12 and 15, after sowing. (Based on the Encyclopaedia Britannica). Another authority argues Consus was the deity of secret plans and conspiracies

CROM CRUACH
Origin: Celtic Irish
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: CROMM CRÚIACH, CENNCROITHI, CENN CRUACH, CROM DUBH
A significant fertility and possibly solar deity, the tutelary deity of County Cavan, Ulster. In one Christian detraction he is described as 'head of all the gods'. In a late story he is banished by St Patrick who, wielding a sledgehammer, smashes Crom's gold or silver image at the centre of a circle of twelve stone or bronze figures, who then sink into the ground. The 'demon' released then turns to stone, imprinted with the saint's crozier. In pre-Christian Ireland he demanded sacrifice of worshippers' firstborn, for which he granted good milk and grain yields. The golden image and 12 figures suggest a solar deity surrounded by zodiacal symbols. In 1921 fragments of a leaning stone found near a Bronze Age stone circle at the village of Killycluggin in County Cavan supported the notion of a cult site there that required 'exorcism' at some stage. 'Crom' may be related etymologically to the Breton word 'cromlech' and suggests 'bent', while dubh means 'dark' or 'black' and thus, in Christian eyes, evil. One idea is that Crom is bent from carrying sheaves of grain home from harvest, which reinforces the theory that he is essentially a fertility deity

CUPID
Origin: Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: AMOR
The Roman god of love, also known as AMOR and the equivalent of the Greek EROS. Cupid is frequently shown shooting his bow to inspire romantic love. There are many differing stories about Cupid’s parentage. Cicero provides three different lineages: in the first, Cupid is the son of MERCURY(HERMES) and DIANA (ARTEMIS); in the second he is the son of Mercury and VENUS (APHRODITE); and finally, and son of MARS (ARES) and Venus. Plato mentions two of these, and Hesiod’s Theogony, the most ancient Greek theography, says that Cupid was created coevally with sex, CHAOS and the earth. Other mythological writings, however, portray cupid with a dual nature. As the son of JUPITER (ZEUS) and Venus he is a lively youth who delights in pranks and spreading love. But as the son of NYX and EREBUS he is known for riotous debauchery. Cupid's cult was closely associated with that of Venus, with Cupid being worshipped as devotedly as she. Additionally, Cupid's power was supposed to be even greater than hers over the dead in Hades, the creatures of the sea and the gods in Olympus. Some of the cults of Cupid suggested that Cupid as son of Night and Hell mated with Chaos to produce both men and gods, making the gods love the goddesses more than anyone. In some stories he is the husband of PSYCHE

CYBELE
Origin: Greek
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: CYBEBE, KYBELE, KYBEBE, KYBELIS, GREAT MOTHER OF THE GODS, DINDYMENE, AGDISTIS
The worship of Cybele appears to have arisen in Phrygia, Asia Minor. Excavations at Çatalhöyük in Anatolia revealed a 6000BC statuette in a grain bin, one of the earliest representations of a mother goddess. She is depicted as an overly voluptuous naked woman, possibly giving birth on a throne, with her hands resting on the heads of felines, possibly lions. Her ‘Kubeleyan Mother’, perhaps ‘Mountain Mother’; Lydian Kuvava; Greek: KYBELE, KYBEBE, KYBELIS, was an originally Anatolian form of Earth Mother or Great Mother. Little is known of her oldest Anatolian cults, other than her association with mountains, hawks and lions. She was Phrygia’s state deity; her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor, and spread from there to mainland Greece and its more distant western colonies from around the 6th century BCE. In Greece, Cybele met with a mixed reception. She was partially assimilated to aspects of Gaia, the Earth, her Minoan equivalent RHEA, and the Corn-Mother goddess DEMETER. Some city-states, notably Athens, evoked her as a protector but her most celebrated Greek rites and processions show her as an essentially foreign, exotic mystery-goddess, who arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music, wine, and a disorderly, ecstatic following. Uniquely in Greek religion, she had a transgendered or eunuch mendicant priesthood. Many of her Greek cults included rites to her divine ‘Phrygian’ castrate shepherd-consort ATTIS, whose rites and myths appear to have been Greek inventions. In Greece, Cybele is associated with mountains, town and city walls, fertile nature, and wild animals, especially lions. In Rome, Cybele was known as Magna Mater, Great Mother. The Roman state adopted and developed a particular form of her cult, and claimed her conscription as a key religious component in their success against Carthage during the Punic Wars. Roman mythographers reinvented her as a Trojan goddess, and thus an ancestral goddess of the Roman people by way of the Trojan prince Aeneas. With Rome’s eventual hegemony over the Mediterranean world, Romanised forms of Cybele’s cults spread throughout the Roman Empire. The meaning and morality of her cults and priesthoods were topics of debate and dispute in Greek and Roman literature, and remain so in modern scholarship. One interpretation of her name is Giver Of Life To All. Her priests were known to castrate themselves and wear women’s clothes out of respect to ATTIS her son, whom she drove insane with desire and who castrated himself under a pine tree

CYCLOPS
Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Monster
Aliases: KYKLOPES, CYCLOPES, ARGES, BRONTES, STEROPES
The Elder Cyclops, ARGES, BRONTES and STEROPES, were three one-eyed giants, respected craftsmen and builders. Their father URANUS (Ouranos) feared their strength and imprisoned them in Tartarus. ZEUS later freed them on the understanding they would fight in the war against the TITANS. They forged thunderbolts for Zeus, POSEIDON’s trident, HADES’ helmet of invisibility and are reputed to have constructed the first altar and taught men the art of building walls and battlements. In later legends four more Cyclops were added – EURYALOS, ELATREUS, TRAKHIOS and HALIMEDES - presumably sons of the first three. APOLLO(N) killed the Cyclops that forged the thunderbolt Zeus used to kill AESCLEPIUS. The tribe of Younger Cyclops, that Odysseus encountered on his travels, were a different breed, probably born from the blood of the castrated Uranus

The Cyhyreath also sounds for Welsh people dying far from home

CYRENE

APOLLO, who was watching, fell in love with her and took her off to Libya. By him she is the mother of ARISTAEUS, and by ARES the mother of Diomedes of Thrace. The Libyan legend helps explain the founding of a Libyan colony in 631BC by Theran emigrants
