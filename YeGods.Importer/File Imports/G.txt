Origin: Africa
Sex: M
Category: Monster
Aliases: None
A leopard-like or cheetah-like monster from the legends of the Khoikhoi people of south-western Africa, his name means the 'thrower down' or 'not-a-leopard/cheetah'. The creature sat on the edge of a great pit and dared passers-by to throw stones at him. The stone always rebounded and killed the thrower, who then fell into the pit. When the trickster-god HEITSI-EIBIB approached it, he declined to aim a stone until he had diverted the monster's gaze. He then struck Ga-gorib under the ear and tumbled it into its own trap. Another version of this legend tells of how Heitsi-eibib was chased around the pit before he slipped and fell in it. He managed to escape but had to wrestle with the monster for a long while before he succeeded in pushing Ga-Gorib into the pit (MFL)

GAD
Origin: Arabic
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
A generic term for a protector-deity in pre-Islamic Northern Arabia. The word is Semitic for ‘fortune’, and a gad may well have been little more than a lucky charm. ‘Gad-of-a-place’ or ‘Gad-of-a-tribe’ is the common form in Arabic. He appears in Western Semitic regions and in Punic (Carthaginian) domains as well as in pre-Biblical Anatolia, so is obviously well-travelled. He may have been syncretised with the Greeks' TYCHE in later times. The suggestion that Gad gave us the English ‘god’ is curious but etymologically unsound

In early Greek mythology, Gaea was the principle of order, equivalent of the Mesopotamian APSU, set against CHAOS, or URANUS. She appears first in Attica. She is created by the primordial beings AETHER and HEDERA, Heaven and Earth and, encouraged by EROS, she becomes the mother of PONTOS (the sea) and OURANOS/URANUS (heaven), sometimes Uranus's wife. She is the mother of CRONUS and RHEA. She is the primal goddess EARTH, mother of all. On the dark side, she created the race of the TITANS and the underworld monster TYPHON. As the Greek pantheon developed GAEA declined in importance but maintained a role as a marital guardian and binder of oaths. Her oracle at Delphi predated that of APOLLO. Later still she becomes the equivalent of DEMETER, the corn-mother whose daughter is corn-spirit KORE. See TERRA MATER and TELLUS

Category: Deity
Aliases: None
A Sicilian nereid (sea-nymph) loved by the Cyclops POLYPHEMUS, whom she spurned for the shepherd youth ACIS. Galataea and Acis, hiding, listened as Polyphemus sang of his love for Galataea. Polyphemus discovered them and crushed Acis under a rock. Galataea changed Acis’ blood into a river bearing his name (modern Fiume de Jaci). In a second version, Galataea and Polyphemus married and had an unnamed son, who became an ancestor of the Gauls. NB: The process of theo-legendising is not dead. Sir W S Gilbert, as late as 1871, is apparently the first to give PYGMALION a miraculous gift from APHRODITE and call it Galataea. In earlier stories, an unnamed statue is brought to life by Aphrodite in answer to Pygmalion’s prayers. Gilbert gives that statue the name of Galataea, and Gilbert alone, though the event has been ‘backdated’ by some scholars to the time of the formation of Greek legend

Shiva, on returning to his heavenly home after a long stint on earth, found a stranger at his door, and immediately cut off his head. Parvati told him it was his own son, so, desperate to make amends, Shiva cut off the head of a passing elephant and placed it on his son’s shoulders.

GOD
Origin: universal: but semiotically Judeo-Christian
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
Strictly, any male deity with supernatural powers or attributes. Among Judeo-Christian and Muslim peoples, the name belongs to a specific entity, simply called God. Islam calls him ALLAH. Judaism names him as JAHWEH or JEHOVAH. Of the Abrahamic religions, only Christianity has created images of God, and only Christianity has permitted icons of god and other elements of the religion to be used as foci for worship. Muslims (with the exception of a small number of Shias) are forbidden to depict this supreme deity in any way. Neither they nor Jews, generally speaking, see the supreme deity as anything but numinous. In the Judeo-Christian tradition he is male, often depicted in religious iconography as being elderly, white-bearded, usually stern and fierce looking, powerful and authoritative. In this manifestation, he assumes the characteristics of fatherhood. Occasionally he is depicted as benevolent or even pained. He has a variety of names: in the Judaic tradition, JHWH, a nomenclature specifically designed to be unpronounceable, since it was improper in the earliest Judaic traditions for God to have a name. In Christian translation, this became JEHOVAH, and following 19th century Germanic scholarship, JAHWEH. He is 'The Almighty', 'Our Father', and other descriptive terms abound. He is the supreme deity, the creator figure, in existence before time, all-powerful, all-seeing, ever-present. He is the father of all, though his paternity is linked specifically in the Christian tradition to JESUS, whom he sent as an emissary to earth to reveal his nature to all people. His gift through Jesus was the power of the HOLY SPIRIT, a concept that thus doubly compromises the notion of a truly unique and almighty figure. The paradox is resolved, in religious if not in logical terms, by the concept of the TRINITY, in which the father, son and spirit are manifestations of the one god. In Judaism as in Christianity, God has attributes of retribution and punishment, though in Christianity, largely through the intervention of his son, God is also seen as loving, compassionate and forgiving, a personal god. If he is seen as living anywhere, it is in ‘heaven’, a place or state to which all his followers aspire, and will enter following their death on earth. For the vast majority of other religious disciplines, faiths and sects, a supreme being may take on single or multiple characteristics and names; that being more often than not lives in heaven, either in, or at the edges of, or beyond, the sky; it is often male/fatherlike; it is usually powerful and willing to display that power in aggressive or angry ways. That being may be entirely numinous, or have several attributes, including taking the form of objects such as a storm, standing stone or bear, or a person such as an avatar, shaman or prophet, either temporarily or permanently. Or that being might have very specific characteristics; Jews and Christians are uncomfortable with the ‘white-haired old man’ image, but he persists. Muslims are not generally permitted to consider Allah as having any form at all

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: THE ONE GREAT SPIRIT, ONE GREAT SPIRIT
Generic term for the creator and master of all the world; found not only in translations of Haudenosaunee ideas, but used as a term by non-Indians for similar ideas among many tribes. See WAKAN TANKA among the Lakota. Among the Lakota, the Great Spirit manifests in any of several entities or aspects; see ADEKAGAGAWAA, ARESKOUI, HAWENNIYO, SHAGODYOWEHGOWAH, TAREYAWAGON, and TARHUHYI AWAHKU. In the Comanche tradition, the Great Spirit’s innate goodness and purity is thwarted by the trickster god OLD COYOTE. The Great Spirit is a concept common among many of the tribal people of North America, usually explained by means of symbols. The Spirit is seen as supreme creator and source of all power, but is represented not in human, animal or natural form but in geometric symbols. The god is a Circle with a Centre, or a Circle with Two Halves to represent male and female, dark and light, good and evil, cold and hot. In some myths, Mother Earth has two sons. On the east coast, SISUTL is a two-headed serpent who punishes and rewards/protects. These halves are harmonious, not in conflict. In some communities, the Circle is overlaid with a Triangle, which represents the unity of cause, action and result (ie drought - raindance - rain). The Sioux see a Square superimposed on the Circle, representing numerous aspects of life - four primary colours, four elements, four seasons, four winds and so on. Other tribal people see the Square actually divided into Four. Some people - the Ojibwa, and the Sioux, for instance - have a seven pointed figure to represent the four directions, plus up and down, plus the central, or power, point, the point of being/now. The Ojibwa call these the SEVEN GRANDFATHERS
