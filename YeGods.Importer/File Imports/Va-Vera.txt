VACUNA
Origin: Roman: Sabine
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
There are two theories on the nature of this ancient Sabine goddess, who was adopted by the Romans after they conquered Sabine territory north-east of Rome and was associated thereafter with DIANA, CERES, NIKE, MINERVA, BELLONA, VENUS and VICTORIA. The first is that she was an agricultural deity, worshipped by rural folk after a successful day in the fields – a goddess to thank after the day’s labour (vacui = leisure). Her sanctuaries, at Tibur and in sacred woods at Reate confirm her rural identity, though her sanctum in Rome, with its December festival, does not: it suggests she is a goddess of victory. The writer Horace appears to ask her favours for travelling friend, leading some to conclude she was a goddess of absent friends and relatives

VENUS
Origin: Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
Venus is the Roman equivalent of the Greek APHRODITE, and both started life as goddesses of gardens and vineyards. In this role she was known as V. LUBENTIA or LUBENTINA, titles which show her Oscan origins, where she is known as HERENTINA and LIBITINA. Her earliest Roman name seems to have been MURCIA, as a goddess of spring gardens and flowers, a title transmuted to MYRTEA, goddess of myrtles. In this aspect she is closely related to FLORA. As Venus grew in importance she took on the role of the foremost Roman goddess of sexual love and beauty. She never lost her patronage of the grape, though; her festival of the Vinalia Rustica (August 18) remains the major one, dedicated to JUPITER and V. LIBITINA. The Veneralia (April 1) honours V. VERTICORDIA, who later became the protector against vice. This festival was shared with FORTUNA VIRILIS, and Verticordia (Concordia as a goddess who turns the hearts of women towards chastity and modesty). A minor festival, the Vinalia, on April 23, celebrated the opening of one of her temples and was dedicated to V. ERYCINA (her Sicilian aspect, first introduced into Rome in 217 BCE) and JUPITER. As V. GENETRIX she was worshipped at the mother of AENEAS and patroness of the Julian dynasty; as V. VICTRIX or VICTORIX, goddess of victory, she is represented on numerous Roman coins. In this role she is the seducer of MARS, a popular theme in Roman art. She is the daughter of JUPITER and the Titan DIONE, the mother of CUPID and of PRIAPUS by BACCHUS. She became the wife of VULCANUS. In 217 BCE the concept of feast of DII CONSENTES, Rome’s counterpart to the Greek Olympians, was introduced, and Venus became identified with Aphrodite. Julius Caesar built a temple to her in the Forum in 46 BCE. The Templum Urbis built by Hadrian in 135 CE was dedicated to ROMA and V. GENETRIX
