EA
Origin: Mesopotamia
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ENKI
The third member of the primary triad of the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon of ANU or AN, and BEL or ENLIL. EA’s chief centre of worship was the city of Eridu in southern Babylonia. Also known to the Sumerians as ENKI, or Lord of the Earth, or, more accurately, the depths of the earth rather than its surface or materialism. His name may be a conflation of An and KI (heaven + earth). In texts from 2400BC he is also called king of the apsu, or 'sweet' freshwater deeps, and is known as an oracular god. His consort is DAMKINA. His offspring include ASHALLUHA, NIN-SAR (by NINHURSAG), NINIMMA (by NINKURRA) and UTTU (by NINMAH). Hammurabi calls Enki the wisest of the gods, the all-knowing, with the power to deprive men of their understanding. Semitic stories of Ea, the ‘organiser of the earth’ can have him behave very foolishly. The name Ea is written as two signs meaning ‘house’ and ‘water’ and a common symbol is of a man covered with the body of a fish, with two streams of water, the Tigris and Euphrates, issuing from his shoulders. He is the patron of artists and craftsmen, exorcists and the god of physicians, a creator god. In the deluge he saves UTNAPISHTIM, the Babylonian Noah. He is later relegated and becomes father of the chief god MARDUK. Synonyms include LUGAL-ID(AK), 'lord of the river'; LUGALABZU(AK), 'lord of the deep'; and NUDIMMUD, 'image fashioner'

EL
Origin: Ugaritic/Canaanite/Hebraic
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ELLEL, EL ELYON, IL, ILAH, ILU
The term is synonymous with the Semitic word for ‘God’, and, in the Hebraic tradition a synonym for Yahweh. The Il form is specifically Canaanite texts from Ras Shamra. The longer form of El's name is ILAH. In texts from Ras Shamra in Syria (Ugarit), El (‘The Bull’) is the offspring of an older and more powerful creator-deity, El-Eb, 'God the Father'. El is described as the titular head of the Semitic pantheon, with ASHERAH as his wife. He was father of all the gods except the sun-god BAAL. El did not enjoy universal supremacy in the pre-Islamic Arab world; in Palmyra a more central role went to BEL or BAAL (‘Lord’) and in Nabataean Petra to BELSHAMIN (‘Lord of the heavens’). In the Hittite world, the sky god ELLEL is his equivalent. El is, however, a term common throughout the Semitic world. He is the equivalent to the Hurrian god KUMARBI and the Greek god CRONUS/KRONOS. Immediately prior to the Islamic era El rose to supremacy among the Sabaeans, where he was known as Merciful, Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Great One of Judah. One text speaks of his son Christ the Victorious. He is linked traditionally and phonetically to ALLAH. In Samaria his form (EL) ELYON translates as ‘God most high’

The name is a Judaic appropriation of two elements that can be traced back to the Ugaritic (northern Syrian) or Canaanite culture that was subsumed by Judaism (See EL). It is often translated as 'God Almighty'. Shaddai was one of many Canaanite deities. Several suggestions have been made for the name's origin. 'God of the mountains' is one translation, which would refer to the Mesopotamian divine mountain, and thence to a tribal god of the early Mesopotamians. In Exodus 6:3, El Shaddai is identified explicitly with the God of Abraham and with YAHWEH. If it's a toponym, Shaddai is a late Bronze Age Amorite city on the banks of the Euphrates in northern Syria. As a theonym, the name referred to in Exodus as the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and again in the Book of Job, might mean 'god of strength', the overpowerer or destroyer

In the Babylonian creation myth the Enuma Eliš, Enbilulu 'knows the secrets of water' and 'makes all things flourish', a function that was revered from earliest times in the story of Mesopotamian civilisation – and indeed, Enbilulu is placed in charge of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates and all their tributaries, irrigation ditches and canals, by chief god ENKI. Through this function he quickly becomes the protective deity of farmers and farming, and even later, the god of metalworking. In the Sumerian story of ENLIL and NINLIL he is their son. In later Babylonian times he becomes the son of EA and is connected with ADAD. As Mesopotamian society becomes more complex, Enbilulu regulates the land for grazing and watering places, opens the wells and fills them with abundant water, and presides over all growing things. His names include Epadun, 'The lord who sprinkles the field'; Enbilulugugal, 'lord of abundance, opulence and ample crops'; and Hegal, 'who provides rich rains over the wide earth and provides vegetation for the people's consumption' (MJ)

Category: Deity
Aliases: ENKIMDU, EABANI, ENKITA
Close friend of the demigod, king and hero GILGAMESH, whose illness and death inspires Gilgamesh to strive for deification and thereby immortality. His name means 'ENKI's creation'. He is formed from clay and saliva by ARURU, the goddess of creation. He is a wild man, raised by animals and ignorant of human ways until seduced by the sacred prostitute SHAMHAT. He meets and wrestles with Gilgamesh, king of Uruk and the two find each other equal in strength. Enkidu, however, is the antithesis of the urban and urbane king, embodying the wild or natural world

ENLIL
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ELLIL
Enlil is part of the supreme early Mesopotamian triad of deities with AN(U) and ENKI. In most traditions he is the first-born son of An(u) and earth-mother KI, and brother of the primal creator-goddess ARURU, though he has been depicted as a descendant of Enki and NINKI. Enlil's wife/sister is NINLIL (or, later, SUD), whom in the Akkadian tradition he raped and was punished by banishment to the underworld. His sons include their firstborn the moon god NANNA/SU'EN/SIN, grain goddess NISABA, NINURTA/NINGURSU, NAMTAR (by ERISHKIGAL), PABILSAG, NERGAL, NINAZU, INAN(N)A, UTU and IŠKUR. He is 'lord of the storm', of the length and breadth of the land, of the wind and of destiny - the deity who gives and takes away the breath of life. His word sanctified kingship and his commands could not be altered. His temple at Nippur was the religious hub of Mesopotamia until 2000BC. Though he arises in early Sumerian times, he remains a force to be reckoned with through Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) times and is found in Hittite and Canaanite scripts. In later Akkadian, when he is rendered in scripts as Ellil, he is the son of ANSHAR and KISHAR and his consort becomes MULLILTU. In one late tradition the Princess of the Copper Winnowing Pan, Sud, tutelary goddess of Šuruppag (a city-state in southern Mesopotamia), is equated with Ninlil and therefore becomes his wife – a political gesture, probably, bringing Šuruppag into the pantheon of Nippur. Enlil's vizier and messenger is NUSKU

Aliases: EPANE, ICCONA
A Romanised Gallic goddess of horses, asses and mules and, because of this, worshipped by horse and mule workers and cavalry. Sculptures have her a) sitting sidesaddle on a horse or colt, b) imperially throned and standing in front of a horse or horses, c) lying half-naked on a horse. She is often carrying a horn of plenty, a goblet or an ordinary bowl, sometimes a loaf of bread. Sometimes her companion is a dog, which in mythology is universally a guardian of the gates of hell. Her origins appear to have been in Gaul (Alesia), Germany and the Danube basin, what Julius Caesar named the 'Three Gauls' – G. Celtica, G. Gallicia and G. Belgica. Her worship is entirely within the Roman Empire territories at their height, and is concentrated in Western Europe. She arrived in Rome in imperial times as AUGUSTA, patron of the imperial household, with a festival on December 18. Her name, which is Gaulish for 'divine mare' or 'she who is like a mare' may survive in the modern word ‘pony’ (epona.net). On the rare occasions she is detected by sculpture or inscription in Celtiberian territory, she is known as EPANE or ICCONA. She appears to have a connection with thermal springs, in which circumstances she appears nymphically naked

ERESHKIGAL
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer, Akkad, Babylon
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: IRKALLA
Queen of the underworld, the 'great lady under the earth'. The Sumerian underworld was called Irkalla, and Ereshkigal takes the name of the place in the same way that Greek HADES is both god and location. Her cult centre was at Kutha, on the banks of the eastern branch of the upper Euphrates, north of Nippur and about 25 miles northeast of Babylon. It was known as the gateway into Irkalla. The goddess ISHTAR calls Ereshkigal her older sister in the Sumerian hymn The Descent of Inanna (in later Babylonian myth, The Descent of Ishtar) in which Ishtar/Inanna visits the land of the dead and is ultimately forced to spend six months of the year there. Together with her consort NERGAL she rules the underworld, also called ‘the big land’, from which no-one returns. One day Nergal was sent to her from heaven with an offering of food. They fell in love with each other, and when he had to leave, she was in tears and threathened ANU that she would revive all the dead, over whom she ruled, and send them back to earth, ‘so that they will outnumber the living’, unless Nergal was sent back to her, for ever, as a husband. Her minister NAMTAR had to go to heaven as her messenger, for Ereshkigal felt that she was already pregnant. At last Nergal came storming down the stairs, broke down the seven gates and burst into the goddess’s palace straight into her passionate embrace, ‘to wipe her tears.’ Ereshkigal is dark and violent, befitting her role as goddess of the underworld. As ruler over the shades, Ereshkigal receives the mortuary offerings made to the dead. She is the mother of NINAZU and another consort is GUGULANA. In the Sumerian cosmogony she was carried off to the underworld after the separation of heaven and earth. She is often praised in hymns. Ereshkigal was probably once a sky-goddess. She is the equivalent of the Semitic goddess ALLATU (MKL, MJ)

Dionysius sent a plague of madness, and all the maidens of Athens hanged themselves, becoming stars. Icarius, Erigone and her dog Maera became the Boötes, (Arcturus), Virgo and Procyon respectively. Icarius and Erigone were later propitiated by a festival called the Swing (Aiora), in which small images were hung in tree branches and offerings of fruit were made

ESHMUN
Origin: Levantine/Canaanite
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ESHMOUN, ESMUN, ESMOUN
A Phoenician god of healing and tutelary god of Sidon since the Iron Age, he was also worshipped in Tyre, Beirut, Cyprus, Sardinia and Carthage. A Phoenician source recounts the legend that SYDYK, nickname ‘The Righteous’ fathered seven sons equated with the Greek DIOSCURI or CABIERI and then fathered an eighth by one of the seven TITANIDES or ARTEMIDES (See Kotharat) who in the original document was called Eshmunus. The name Eshmun appears to mean ‘the Eighth’. Another source says that the AESCLEPIUS worshipped in Beirut was neither Greek nor Egyptian, but a native Phoenician divinity, implying that Eshmun was the god being worshipped. It appears that the Beirut Aesclepius was a youth fond of hunting. He was seen by the goddess Astronoë, who is likely to be a version of ASTARTE, who so harassed him with amorous pursuit that in desperation he castrated himself and died. Astronoë then named the youth Paeon ‘Healer’, restored him to life from the warmth of her body, and changed him into a god. Pausanias quotes a Sidonian as saying that the Phoenicians claim Apollo as the father of Asclepius, as do the Greeks, but unlike them do not make his mother a mortal woman. The Sidonian then continued with an allegory which explained that Apollo represented the sun, whose changing path imparts to the air its healthiness which is to be understood as Asclepius. This allegory seems likely a late invention. Also Apollo is usually equated with the Phoenician plague god Resheph. This might be a variant version of Eshmun's parentage, or Apollo might also be equated with Sadyk, Sadyk might be equated with Resheph. He may have links with MELQART and the mother goddess CAELESTIS

ESHU

Eshu is the orisha of the Yoruba people who acts as messenger between human and the creator god OLODUMARE, knowing all languages and the power of herbs. He is a god of the crossroads and gateways, carrying a set of keys, and all points where chance, accident and change might take place. But he is also a phallic and fertility deity, recognised as a trickster and a child. His manifestation as Elegua is Eshu under the influence of OBATALA, the father of all orishas and mankind, under whom he is a protective, benevolent influence. In modern times, when Yoruba headmen have been asked, Eshu has been described as a handsome young half-caste man with three tribal scars on his cheeks. Elsewhere he is described as short, dark-skinned, smoking a pipe and with candy or his fingers in his mouth. His sacred days are Sunday and Monday and feast days are January 1, June 13 and November 2. He enjoys hard sweets, coconuts, strong drink and cigars. His favourite animal sacrifices are black and white hens and she-goats. As a household protector, his altar can be found behind the front door of a home or immediately to the left of the front door outside. That altar should never be higher than a human. He is known as Legba to the Benin people of Dahomey

One of the Celts’ principal deities, known and worshipped throughout Europe and the British Isles. His name means ‘lord’ or ‘master’ and was linked by the Roman writer Lucan with two other major Celtic deities, TARANIS and TEUTATES, though there is no suggestion they were a triad. Esus’s victims were said to be ritually stabbed and hung on trees, and he is thought to have originated as a god of trees. Esus is notably pictured in Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris as bearded and wearing a short tunic that leaves his right shoulder bare. He is cutting a branch from a willow tree. Another face of the same relief shows the same willow tree with a bull beneath it. Two wading birds stand on the bull’s back and a third between its horns. This recurrent depiction is called the Tauros Trigaranus, or Bull With Three Cranes. Esus’s Roman equivalent is MERCURY

Origin: Greek
Sex: F

Aliases: HELLOTIS
In legend, the daughter of either 'sun-red' PHOENIX (the Iliad) or of Phoenix's father AGENOR, King of Tyre, inferring Phoenician origins. Archaeological discoveries of coinage in 2012 in Sidon in the Lebanon featuring Europa riding a bull reinforce the Phoenician connection. She is from a lineage descended from IO, the nymph loved by ZEUS, who was transformed into a heifer. The Syracusan poet Moschus says her mother was Queen Telephassa, but elsewhere her mother is Argiope. Her brothers are CADMUS, who brought the alphabet to Greece, and CILIX, who gave his name to Cilicia in Asia Minor. Europa was wooed by ZEUS in the form of a white bull and carried off to Crete, where she bore him three sons: MINOS, (king of Crete) SARPEDON (prince of Lycia) and RHADAMANTHUS (king of the Cyclades islands). All three became judges of the underworld when they died. Another legend says she came to Crete after being kidnapped by the Minoans. Europa is worshipped under the name of HELLOTIS in Crete, where she married ASTERION (also rendered as Asterius)

EVANDER
Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: EUANDROS
Though Evander is a migrant from Arcadia, in the central Peloponnesus, his Greek ancestry is less relevant than the fact that he settled on the Palatine Hill in Rome. He is the son of the goddess CARMENTIS or Carmenta and the god HERMES/MERCURY. Traditionally he is the founder of the festival the Lupercalia and is said to have invented writing. There is a theory his name in Greek, ‘euandros’ or ‘strong man’, can be identified with the Greek for strength, ‘rhome’, and thus with the city of Rome, though a more accurate translation appears to be ‘good man’
