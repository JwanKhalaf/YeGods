Category: Deity
Aliases: APHAIA
Goddess (apparently uniquely) of the island Aegina in the Saronic Gulf west of Athens, and linked with the nymph BRITOMARTIS of Crete. Both goddesses appear to be localised manifestations of ARTEMIS or ATHENA. Aphaea is ancient, possibly as early as the 14th century BC, though Britomartis is even earlier. She is associated with fertility, the seasons and agriculture. Local legend is that she was caught in nets while fleeing from a lustful King Minos, and Artemis made her a goddess

APHRODISIAS
Origin: Caria (now SW Anatolia, Turkey)
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: APHRODITE
It's debatable whether she is a deity separate from APHRODITE; perhaps more likely that Aphrodite had a cult centre here from ancient Greek times to about 300BC. The area is famous for white and blue-grey marble, and statues of Aphrodite carved here later turned up in many other parts of the Roman Empire

APHRODITE
Origin: Greek
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: KYPRIS, CYTHERA, CYTHEREA, ANADYOMENE, APHRODITE URANIA, APHRODITE PANDEMOS
The goddess of sexual love, fertility and beauty, though in her earlier form she was the goddess of war. She is linked with the Phoenician goddess ASTARTE, the Syro-Palestinian ASHTAR and the Mesopotamian ISHTAR. She was also worshipped as goddess of the sea: the poet Hesiod has her born from sea-foam and URANUS’ severed testicles. She is said to have risen from the sea at Pafos, (Paphos) Cyprus, where she is known as KYPRIS — or Cythera, sometimes CYTHEREA. In Homeric legend she is the daughter of ZEUS and DIONE, one of Zeus’s consorts. She was initially wed to HEPHAESTUS, then ARES, but had many lovers, mortal and immortal. She was the rival of PERSEPHONE, queen of the underworld, for the love of ADONIS, son of ANCHISES, her Trojan shepherd lover.  She was the mother of HARMONIA, EROS, ANTEROS, HYMENAIOS and (with Anchises) AENEAS. She has a hold over Adonis, in some legends her favourite, because she wounds/castrates/kills him (by arranging to have him attacked by a boar) and is the only one who can ‘heal’ him. Major centres of worship were at Thebes, Sparta and throughout Cyprus, where her priestesses drugged and drank themselves into heights of frenzied ecstasy, worshipping her as the Mother Goddess. Her symbols were a dove, a dolphin, a pomegranate, a swan, a lime tree and a myrtle, though her name is thought to have come from the same root as Latin aper = wild boar with DITE, a water goddess of Asia Minor. A more common translation of her name is ‘foam-born’ (aphro + dite). Though the Greeks thought of her as vain and vicious, the Romans identified her with VENUS and honoured her as the mother of Aeneas. ANADYOMENE is a name of Aphrodite when she is represented as rising from the sea; her cult titles include A. URANIA, queen of the heavens, and A. PANDEMOS, goddess of all the people. Perhaps the most famous legend about Aphrodite concerns the cause of the Trojan War. ERIS, the personification of discord—the only goddess not invited to the wedding of King PELEUS and the sea nymph THETIS — resentfully tossed into the banquet hall a golden apple on which were inscribed the words 'for the fairest.' When Zeus refused to judge between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, the three goddesses who claimed the apple, they asked Paris, prince of Troy, to make the award. Each goddess offered Paris a bribe: Hera, that he would be a powerful ruler; Athena, that he would achieve great military fame; and Aphrodite, that he should have the fairest woman in the world. Paris declared Aphrodite the fairest and chose as his prize Helen of Troy, the wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Paris’s abduction of Helen led to the Trojan War

APIS
Origin: Egypt
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: HAPY, HAPI
Apis is the sacred bull deity whose worship centred on Memphis, at least as far back as 3000BC, later on Alexandria. It was from Alexandria that his worship —  under the name SARAPIS — spread into Greek and Roman culture. His mother is ISIS, who created him from lightning. He probably started life as a fertility god with responsibility for the increase of livestock, though HAPI, possibly an earlier form of Apis, was a Nile god, responsible for the annual flooding of the river and was represented as a somewhat stout, lively androgynous character pouring water on the ground from two large jugs. Hapi, incidentally, is described in the Book Of The Dead as a one of seven gods 'in the train of HORUS'. He is linked with PTAH, the chief god of the Memphis area, and then with OSIRIS as USER-HAPI. Links also exist between Apis and SOKARIS who, like Osiris, was a god of the dead and the underworld. In the form of Apis-Atum he was a solar god, often depicted as a bull with a solar disc between his horns. He was black and white with special markings and possessed oracular abilities

Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ABACUS, AGYEUS, ALEXIKAKOS, APOLLON, APULA, DELIAN, LYCEIUS, NOMIOS, PAEAN, PAIAN, PHOEBUS, PHOIBOS
The worship of Apollo spread across the Greek empire and was exported further afield, where it outlived the empire itself in many instances. Apollo, whose Etruscan name was APULA, was adopted by the Romans. Apollo’s father was ZEUS, (in Roman lore JUPITER) his mother LETO or LATONA, and his twin sister ARTEMIS, both of whom were said to have been born on Delos – hence A. DELIAN, where both were worshipped. Adopted by pastoral communities everywhere, he was a guardian of crops and domesticated animals, often under the by-name of NOMIOS (herdsman). As LYCEIUS he was a ‘protector from wolves’ and as ALEXIKAKOS he was an ‘averter of evil’. His forename, PHOEBUS or PHOIBOS (bright and pure) links him with solar worship, and he was probably a masculine version of an older sun goddess. Indeed, one of his tasks was to harness his chariot with four horses to drive the sun across the sky.  Another forename, AGYIEUS – ‘of the highway’ – links him with travellers. He was a patron of the arts, especially music, where he is pictured playing a golden lyre, and of medicine. He was also a master-archer, nicknamed the Striker From Afar, and fleet-footed athlete, credited with being the first winner at the Olympian games. Apollo’s centre of worship was Delphi, where an oracle was established, and where he was known as Apollo Delphinius, god of prophecy and divination, or Apollo Pythian, the Delphic site being where he killed the snake goddess PYTHON, a female version of the Earth divinity. Another oracle was set up at Abae in Phocis. He was also popular in Anatolia. Another name for him among the Doric Greeks was PAEAN (or PAIAN), who praised him with a special form of hymn, the paean. His bird is the crow, his tree the laurel, and his animal the dolphin. In Homeric legend Apollo was primarily a god of prophecy. He sometimes gave the gift of prophecy to mortals whom he loved, such as the Trojan princess Cassandra. His twin sister, Artemis, was the guardian of young women, and Apollo was the special protector of young men. He taught humans the art of healing and was father to ASCLEPIUS, the god of medicine. Some tales depict Apollo as stern or cruel. According to Homer's Iliad, Apollo answered the prayers of the priest Chryses to obtain the release of his daughter from the Greek general Agamemnon by shooting fiery, pestilential arrows into the Greek army. He also abducted and ravished the young Athenian princess Creusa and abandoned both her and the child born to them. The twins CENTAURUS and LAPITHES in some legends are said to be his sons (mother STILBE). Perhaps because of his beauty, Apollo was represented in ancient art more frequently than any other deity. He is linked to local deities across the Celtic world, Apollo MONTASGUS, Apollo BORVO and Apollo BORMO being exemplary of his Gallic connections alone. His main festival was held at the Ludi Apollini, July 6-13, and on September 23 together with that of DIANA

The Gnostic Basilides proposed the existence of a ‘great archon’ called ABRAXAS, who presided over 365 lesser archons. In the Valentinian Gnostic system archons are replaced by AEONS. Christian orthodoxy found Gnosticism of all kinds abhorrent and it persisted after AD400 only in secret

Origin: Greek
Sex: M
Category: Deity

The god of war or spirit of battle, precursor of the much more popular Roman god of war, MARS. Ares, the son of ZEUS and HERA, represented the spasm or insensate aspects of war – blind courage, superhuman strength, feats of arms, brutality, while the more cultured Mars was a god of victory and triumph. Ares was the men’s god; Mars the officers’. His worship was strongest in northern Greece, and he is thought to have originated in Thrace. Sacrifices were made to him at Sparta; a sacred grove at Colchis was dedicated to him, and there was a men-only festival at another grove in Geronthrae in Laconia. At Tegea he was worshipped as ‘Entertainer of Women’ and in Athens there was a temple at the foot of the Areopagus (Ares’ Hill) where, legend has it, he was tried for murder. In battle he was accompanied by his sister ERIS (‘strife’) and sons – by APHRODITE – DEIMOS and PHOBOS (‘Panic’ and ‘Rout’). HARMONIA, his daughter, apparently stayed at home. By AGLAUROS, daughter of CECROPS, he was the father of ALCIPPE. He sired at least two of HERAKLES’ opponents, CYCNUS or KYKNOS, a vicious killer slain by Herakles, and DIOMEDES of Thrace. Two lesser deities were associated with him: ENYALIUS and ENYO. Enyo was a female counterpart. Protecting his shrine(s) are the arrow-shooting Birds of Ares.

Ariadne is a very early and primitive vegetation goddess, one of the few female entities in Western culture to feature in a renewal myth: in Cyprus, one legend has her dying in childbirth. She appears to have been a Minoan export. In Naxos she was worshipped as the wife of DIONYSUS. In Greek mythology she becomes the daughter of PASIPHAE (herself daughter of the sun god HELIOS) and King MINOS of Crete. Favoured by ZEUS, he gives her a crown, the Corona Borealis. She falls in love with the Athenian hero THESEUS and helps him escape from the Minotaur’s lair. One legend has Theseus abandoning Ariadne on the island of Naxos, where Dionysus found her and married her; another has Theseus accidentally stranding her on the island. When he finally returns, Ariadne has died

The most popular of Greek goddesses, her worship was national, provincial and local. In the Peloponnese and Minoan (Cretan) cultures she was originally a mother or earth goddess named BRITOMARTIS. In this manifestation she is a daughter of ZEUS and LETO (LATONE) and twin sister of APOLLO. She is spotted by King Minos, who unsuccessfully pursues her for several years. She eventually throws herself from a cliff and is caught in fishermen’s nets, earning herself the sobriquet DITYNNA (dityon = net). The Greeks identified her with APHAEA, a primitive local goddess of Aegina. At some stage Aphaea blends with Artemis, who becomes the focus of a tree cult, in which in her sacred grove in Condylea in the Arcadian hills, she appears to have been known as The Hanged One, her effigy hung annually on a tree. At Sparta human sacrifices were made to her initially, but as time went on this was commuted to having children whipped before her statue there. She is akin to the Asian Magna Mater (Great Mother) and the Indo-Iranian ARVI. Elsewhere on Crete and in Attica she was connected with bull worship, being called in Attica Artemis Tauropolis. She is the goddess of wild animals, especially the hind; the hunt, vegetation, chastity and childbirth, and is seen as being responsible for women’s sudden deaths. Outside of the Peloponnesus she is usually depicted with a stag or hunting dog and carrying a bow. She is ‘mistress of the wild beasts’, particularly the wolf, the bear, game and heifers, and as such is closely linked with the Syrian ASTARTE of Hieropolis and ISHTAR. The Spartans called her ORTHO. She is a goddess of the moon, linked with SELENE and HECATE, and thus the Romans adopted her as DIANA. Her titles include KOUROTROPHOS (‘Nurse’), LIMNAEA or A. LIMNATIS (‘Lady of the Lake’), and EILEITHYIA (‘Goddess of childbirth’. Like Diana, she is sometimes depicted lifting her robes to display her sex. In the myth-making process, she accumulated a large retinue of nymphs - regional nature goddesses - to whom were given the erotic tendencies attributed originally to her. Her temple at Ephesus, where she was worshipped as the Mother Goddess, or Oypis ANASSA - was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world

ARTHUR
Origin: Romano-British
Sex: M
Category: Hero
Aliases: None
Legendary and symbolic king whose alleged period of activity (c500-537AD) is clouded in pre-historic doubt. If a true historic figure, then he is a regional vassal-king at best, a roving resistance fighter at worst. Most researchers see him as a Welsh or even Breton renegade against the Saxons whom the Brythonic-speaking Celts quickly turned into a king of grandeur, mystery, romance, tragedy and adventure. The legends draw on traditions from all over the Continent and are interwoven with Christian symbology. His depiction as the Once and Future King (notably by T H White) has established a messianic role for Arthur and bestowed upon him a kind of immortality: he is, according to legend, in suspended animation and will awake to fight if Britain is threatened. The name Arthur has close links with ARTIO, the Celtic bear goddess

ARTIO

In typical illustrations she sits by a short-branched tree in front of a huge bear with a basket of fruit beside her, suggesting a fertility and harvest role. She has a possible link with ARTHUR, since both names have developed from a word for ‘bear’. (Roman: ‘arctus’). She is an aspect of ARTEMIS as A. BRAURONIA. Curiously, one of MERCURY’s nicknames is ARTAIOS

In early Mesopotamian mythology, the sister of the god ENLIL and the goddess who creates humankind. She is perhaps the earliest mother-goddess, a profound fertility figure, as her many names attest. In the first moments of the creation story the Epic of Gilgamesh, the people of Uruk ask AN(U) to be rescued from their despotic king, and An(u) gives the task to Aruru, who creates a new man from clay and her own saliva – ENKIDU, companion for Gilgamesh on his adventures. Later in the Akkadian story and as BELE-TILI (Lady of the Gods) she tries to exclude ENLIL from the end-of-flood celebrations on the grounds that Enlil created the flood in the first place and is thus an enemy of mankind. She is symbolised by variations of the 'omega' sign and is depicted as a midwife or with bare breasts, carrying a child. Her milk was said to have nourished a succession of Sumerian kings, and she legitimised their kingship at coronation. She wears a horned headdress and a tiered skirt, carries a quiver on her shoulders and holds a mace or baton with the 'omega' motif. She is sometimes accompanied by a leashed lion cub. Among her descriptives are NINMAH (Great Queen); NINHURSAG(A) (Queen of the Mountain; but see Ninhursag); MAMA/MAMI, (Mother); NINTU (Lady of Birth); NIN-ZIZNAK (Lady of the Embryo); NIN-DIM (Lady Fashioner); NAGAR-SAGAK (Carpenter of Insides); NIN-BAHAR (Lady Potter); NIN-MAG (Lady Vulva); NIN-SIG-SIG (Lady of Silence); MUD-KESDA (Blood Stauncher); AMA-DUG-BAD (Mother Spreading Knees); AMA-UDUDA (Mother Who Has Given Birth); SAG-ZUDINGIRENAK (Midwife of the Gods); NINMENNA (Lady of the Crown); and MAMMETUM /MAMITU, the goat-headed goddess of destiny and fate, oath- and curse-guardian, a judge in the underworld, and sometime consort of NERGAL

Aliases: ASARLUDU, ASARULUDU, ASARLUHI,  ASALLUHE, ASALLUHI, NAMSHUB
This early Mesopotamian deity, probably a weather-god whose name means 'man-drenching Asal', is associated first as a protector of the city of Kuara or Ku'ar in modern Dhi Qar Province, Iraq, though it appears he was later subsumed  into the nearby Eridu pantheon, Eridu being ENKI's city. At this point he becomes a god of incantations and the intermediary between worshippers and Enki or EA. Namshub means 'shining' and Asaraludu is repeatedly associated with phrases like 'the shining god who lights our path', 'light of the gods', 'wielder of the flaming sword'. Late texts identify him as a son of  Enki and Ea, with their attributes of intelligence and reasoning. Even later becomes closely linked with MARDUK of Babylon.  In Sumerian and Akkadian mythology Asaruludu is one of the ancient Annunaki, the 'children of (sky-god) AN'.

Aliases: ASKLEPIOS, AESCULAPIUS
The Greeks knew him as ASKLEPIOS, the Romans as AESCULAPIUS. He is the Greek god of medicine, patron of physicians and healers, and though regarded as a deity, lived his life as a human. He is the son of APOLLO and the Thessalonian nymph CORONIS. The centaur CHIRON taught him the art of healing. His daughter is HYGIEIA and his two sons, also physicians, are PODALEIRIOS and MACHAON. He was killed by ZEUS with a thunderbolt as punishment for bringing the dead back to life. His worship appears to have originated in Thessaly (Epidaurus) but spread to Kos (where a guild, the Asklepiadai, still exists) then throughout Greece and was introduced to Rome in 293BC, where it continued until Christiansation in about 400AD. His sanctuaries are often health resorts, where exercise, bathing and dietary regimes were prescribed. His temples were often the scene of ‘incubations’, where sick people would sleep isolated from the outside world in the hope that the god would come to them in dreams and prescribe cures for their illnesses. Asclepius's symbol is a rough stick or rod with a snake entwined around it – not the HERMES/MERCURY caduceus, an entirely different symbol. His sanctuaries would contain captive snakes

Wife of the Canaanites’ chief god EL, and mother of BAAL, in which role she was known as BAALAT. The name means ‘She who walks in the Sea’, but she was also called ‘Holiness’ and occasionally ELATH,  ‘The Goddess’.  She was the mother, by EL, of (a numerologically significant) 70 gods, a sign perhaps of multiple takeovers as well as of her fecundity, and as mother goddess she was worshipped throughout Syria and Palestine, though her cult centre appears to have been Ugarit (Ras Shamra). She is the equivalent of DERCETO, the Phoenicians' mother-goddess. Her sister is ANAT (in north Africa, TANIT). She has close links with ASTARTE. Attempts to depict her as YAHWEH’s consort remain hypothetical, though archaeology indicates she was being worshipped in southern Palestine and Jordan in 700BCE alongside the Hebrews’ chief male god. Her fertility symbols are the cow and calf. By 200CE she has become ATARGATIS and is described by one writer as the ‘Syrian goddess’. As Atargatis, her symbols are a snake twined round the Tree of Life (Garden of Eden reference here, perhaps), or a fish, or a spindle, or a tree trunk. Her name in Hebrew/Ugaritic means 'grove', translated in the New English Bible as 'sacred pillars'. In Jeremiah 7:18 she is referred to as the 'queen of heaven'  - the context being that the prophet was ranting against  'idolatrous' Jews who were baking cakes for her (c. 600BCE)

Sex: F

Aliases: ASTAR, AŠTAROTH, ATHTAR, ATHTART, ATHTARTU, ASHTART, ASHTORETH, ASHTAROTH,  ATHTAR, ATTAR, ISHTAR, ISTAR
This powerful goddess of fertility and reproduction, guardian of shepherds, is known by many linked names throughout the Middle East. She can be male or female, but is predominantly female. Her star is Venus. She is recorded earliest under the name ASHTART at Sidon in Phoenicia.  In the Ugaritic (northern Palestinian, now in Turkey) traditions she is known both as ATHTART and ATHTARTU, and is seen in myth as the restrainer of BAAL’s wrath and/or his helper, though by the time of Hebrew dominance of Palestine, she is being depicted as Baal’s female equivalent. Her attributes here are benevolent sexuality, passion and creativity. She is the epitome of femininity and a guardian of nature. Her sacred trees are the acacia and the cypress, her sacred animal the sphinx, and she is often represented by baetyls or upright stones. She is often depicted naked with a crown of cow's horns enclosing a sun-disc. One of her epithets is Athtartu of the Field; another, The Strong One. She is also known as Lady (or Queen) of the Heavens, the Sea, the Earth, and the Underworld. The Hebrews call her ASHTORETH (pl. ASHTAROTH) though her singular form did not emerge until the time of Solomon (10th century BC). In other Aramaic speaking lands she is male and named ATTAR, and survives into pre-Islamic times as a god of war, ' he who is bold in battle'. One of his symbols is a spear-point and his sacred animal is the  oryx antelope. He has power over Venus and is the provider of humankind with water.  In south Arabia this versatile deity is ATHTAR, god of thunderstorms and Venus, dispensing rain and with it fertility. In Abyssinia/Ethiopia she is ASTAR. In Moab (south Palestine) she is ASHTAR. In Canaanite (mid-Palestine) territories she is the male ASHTART, where legend has him trying to unsuccessfully to usurp the throne of the dead god BAAL-HADAD. Though just a few miles north in Phoenicia he is female again, as ASTARTE, a development of Ashtart. Her Assyro-Babylonian and Akkadian name is ISHTAR, though here and in Western Semitic mythology she is a male deity, god of the morning star. As the male Ishtar and in semi-arid regions of western Asia he is sometimes worshipped as a rain-god. It is likely that in southerly regions he is the same god as DHU-SAMANI. As worship spreads into other cultures, she is exclusively female. At the time of her export into Egypt at the time of the 18th dynasty, where she was identified as a manifestation of ISIS and HATHOR, she was also being worshipped in Cyprus, Sicily, Sardinia and Carthage. When she arrives in Greece the Greeks see her as a form of APHRODITE, SELENE or JUNO
