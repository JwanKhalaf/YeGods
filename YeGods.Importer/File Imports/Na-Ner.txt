NABU
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer, Assyria, Babylon
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: NEBO
A West Semitic deity introduced by the Amorites into Mesopotamia about the same time as MARDUK (shortly after 2000BC) and whose star rose with Marduk's, whose scribe and chief minister – and then son - he quickly becomes. Marduk's consort SARPANIT(UM) therefore is his mother and his grandfather is EA. Nabu's consort is TASHMETUM. Marduk becomes Babylon's chief deity, and Nabu settles in nearby Borsippa. His statue is transported into Babylon each new year festival so the god can commune with his father Marduk. In the Assyrian period he rises even further in prominence, with citizens addressing prayers to him and naming their children after him. He takes over the role of the Sumerian goddess NISABA as the god of writing and writers, and keeps and controls the Tablets of Destiny, in which the longevity of all humans is recorded. He also becomes a god of water and fertility. His symbols are the clay writing tablet and stylus. He wears a horned cap and stands with hands clasped in a gesture reminiscent of the priesthood. He rides a winged dragon, Sirrush, that formerly belonged to his father. He appears as Nebo in the Old Testament (Isaiah 46:1). In late Babylonian astrology he is connected with the planet Mercury, and as god of wisdom and writing the Greeks saw him as a manifestation of either APOLLO or HERMES. The Romans obviously equated him with MERCURY

NANNA
Origin: Mesopotamia
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: SIN
The god of the moon to the Sumerians, he is known as SIN to the Akkadians. His chief centre of worship is at Ur. He is father of the sun god UTU (Akkadian SHAMASH) and in some myths of INANNA (Akkadian ISHTAR), the goddess of Venus. The three thus make a celestial triad of sun, moon and Venus. Where the Sumerian and Akkadian cultures may be divided is on Nanna’s lunar nature; he could represent only the full moon, while Sin - or, earlier, SU-EN, represents the crescent. Nanna is the protector of cattle herds and the waterways of the lower Euphrates basin, and the crescent, Nanna’s emblem, is variously seen as the horns of a great bull or the the prow and stern of a boat. In later times, towards the end of Babylonian supremacy, he became more humanised, and was depicted as either a cowherd or a boatman. Nanna’s consort, appropriately, is the reed goddess NINGAL. In spring, Nanna’s worshippers re-enacted the legend of his visit to his father ENLIL at Nippur

NEITH
Origin: Egypt
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: NEIT, NET, NIT
A creator goddess, she is recorded as early as the First Dynasty (3100-2890BC). She is the patron goddess of Sais in the Nile Delta, her mythic birthplace and the capital of all Egypt during the 26th (Saite) Dynasty (664-525BC), Neith's apogee. A later legend from Esna in southern Egypt, where she was one of three tutelary deities, says she emerged from the primeval waters to create the world, subsequently following the Nile north to the delta where she founded Sais, but this is likely to be a back-construction after Neith had been adopted nationally. After rising to national prominence, a sanctuary was dedicated to her in Memphis. Said to be a self-begotten virgin, she later came to be identified as the consort of SET and the mother of the crocodile god SOBEK. She is depicted in the form of a woman wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and bearing a shield with crossed arrows. It is thought that Neith may correspond to the goddess TANIT, worshipped in north Africa by the early Berber culture (existing from the beginnings of written records) and through the first Punic culture originating from the founding of Carthage by DIDO. Ta-nit, meaning in Egyptian the land of Nit, also was a heavenly goddess of war, a virginal mother-goddess and nurse, and, less specifically, a symbol of fertility, the hunt and domestic arts. Her symbol is remarkably similar to the Egyptian ankh and her shrine, excavated at Safepta in southern Phoenicia, revealed an inscription that related her securely to the Phoenician goddess ASTARTE (ISHTAR). Several of the major Greek goddesses also were syncretically identified with Tanit and recognised as Greek by most of the surrounding non-Hellene cultures. Neith was a goddess of war and of hunting and had as her symbol two crossed arrows over a shield. This symbol was displayed on top of her head in Egyptian art. In her form as a goddess of war, she was said to make the weapons of warriors and to guard their bodies when they died. Her name also may be interpreted as meaning water. In time, this meaning led to her being considered as the personification of the primordial waters of creation. She is identified as a great mother goddess in this role as a creator. Neith’s symbol and part of her hieroglyph also bore a resemblance to a loom, and so later in the history of Egyptian myths, she also became goddess of weaving, and gained this version of her name, Neith, which means weaver. At this time her role as a creator changed from being water-based to that of the deity who wove all of the world and existence into being daily on her loom. As a goddess of weaving and the domestic arts she was a protector of women and a guardian of marriage. Since she also was goddess of war, and thus had an additional association with death, it was said that she wove the bandages and shrouds worn by the mummified dead as a gift to them, and thus she began to be viewed as a protector of one of the Four Sons of HORUS, specifically, of DUAMUTEF, the deification of the canopic jar storing the stomach, since the abdomen (often mistakenly associated as the stomach) was the most vulnerable portion of the body and a prime target during battle. It was said that she shot arrows at any evil spirits who attacked the canopic jar she protected. In the late pantheon of the Ogdoad myths, she became identified as the mother of RA and APEP. When she was identified as a water goddess, she was also viewed as the mother of SOBEK, the crocodile. It was this association with water, i.e. the Nile, that led to her sometimes being considered the wife of KHNUM, and associated with the source of the River Nile. She was associated with the Nile Perch as well as the goddess of the triad in that cult centre. She is sometimes pictured wearing the Deshret crown of northern (lower) Egypt, which bears the cobra of WADJET. Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484-425 BC), noted that the Egyptian citizens of Sais in Egypt worshipped Neith and that they identified her with ATHENA, as did Plato. In much later times, her association with war and death led to her being identified with NEPHTHYS (and ANOUKE and ANKT). Nephthys became part of the Ennead pantheon, and thus considered a wife of SET. Despite this, it was said that she interceded in the kingly war between Horus and Set, over the Egyptian throne, recommending that Horus rule. Anouke, a goddess from Asia Minor, was worshipped by immigrants to ancient Egypt. This war goddess was shown wearing a curved and feathered crown and carrying a spear, or bow and arrows. She was known as Mistress of the Bow or Master of Arrows. Within Egypt, she was later assimilated and identified as Neith, who by that time had developed her aspects as a war goddess. In art, Neith sometimes appears as a woman with a weavers’ shuttle atop her head, holding a bow and arrows in her hands. At other times she is depicted as a woman with the head of a lioness, a snake, or a cow. Sometimes Neith was pictured as a woman nursing a baby crocodile, and she was titled 'Nurse of Crocodiles'. As the personification of the concept of the primordial waters of creation in the Ogdoad theology, she had no gender. As mother of Ra, she was sometimes described as the ‘Great Cow who gave birth to Ra'. A great festival, called the Feast of Lamps, was held annually in her honour and, according to Herodotus, her devotees burned a multitude of lights in the open air all night during the celebration. There also is evidence of a resurrection cult involving a woman dying and being brought back to life that was connected with Neith

She is often depicted with a loaf and apples, sometimes with the prow of a ship or other maritime symbols, and has a large dog, possibly a greyhound, at her feet. She is linked to the Nordic FREYA/FREYJA and the Germanic NERTHUS

A deity said to be able to bind together the various aspects of the soul after death. In the form of a virtually invincible two-headed snake he guarded the entrance to Duat, the underworld. Where worship of sun-god RA predominated, Nehebkau was one of the warriors protecting RA on his nightly journey under the earth. As a snake-god he was assumed to have the power to heal snake-bites and scorpion-stings, and was thus the son of scorpion-goddess SERKET. Others saw him as the son of snake-goddess RENENUTET

NEMESIS
Origin: Greek, Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: RHAMUSIA
Nemesis is first worshipped as a fertility goddess akin to ARTEMIS. Her base in pre-Homeric times was at Rhamnus in Attica, from which she is also known as RHAMUSIA. Her concerns were with childbirth and hunting, vegetation and wild animals. Homer mentions her in the guise of a goose, chased by Zeus in the guise of a swan. Nemesis lays an egg as a result of the coupling, and from it HELEN is born. In later manifestations, after her import into the Roman pantheon and her adoption into the DII INFERI, Nemesis adopts more of the attributes her name would imply, ie the indignant disapproval of the gods over human presumption, and the punishment that ensues. She restored natural order and balance by punishing pride and boastfulness and wreaking vengeance on the unjust. In this role, her earliest altar is said to have been in Boeotia. Her cult became very popular with soldiers. She was the patroness of the drill ground under the title N. Campestris. Her attributes are the measuring rod, bridle and yoke, a sword and scourge, wings and wheel, and she rides a chariot drawn by griffins. Unusually, her power is said to extend over gods and men

Origin: Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity

Neptune’s Greek equivalent is POSEIDON (after 399BC) and both are the god of the sea and (earlier, of Neptunus) of irrigation. Neptune is the brother of JUPITER, PLUTO and JUNO and husband to SALACIA. The Romans, who placed him among the ‘top table’ of gods, the DII CONSENTES, imagined the force of the sea and waves as driven by horses, so Neptune, as N. EQUESTER, was patron also of horses and horse racing. His festival, the Neptunalia, was on July 23. He is pictured carrying a trident. Agrippa built the Temple of Neptune in the Campus Martius, but he had another temple in the Circus Flaminius, where a festival was held in his honour on December 1

NERGAL
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: NERGALL, NIRGAL, NIRGALI
A sun-god whose chief seat of worship was the town of Kutha or Cuth(ah), now Tell-Ibrahim in Iraq. He is sometimes identified with SHAMASH but represents a phase of the sun rather than the sun itself, that phase being the sun of noontime and high summer, a period of death and destruction in the Mesopotamian calendar. Thus Nergal is a god of war and pestilence, and as such becomes the deity in charge of the netherworld. In this capacity he is associated with the goddess ALLATU or ERESHKIGAL. In some texts the god NINAZU is the son of Nergal by Allatu/Ereshkigal, though Nergal’s consort is LAZ. Standard iconography has Nergal as a lion, sometimes as a mace topped with the head of a lion. The lion-headed colossi that protected Baylonian temples and palaces probably represent Nergal, whereas bull-headed colossi probably typify NINURTA with whom Nergal is sometimes confused in cuneiform writing. In later developments Nergal has is named the ‘raging king,’ the ‘furious one,’ and suchlike, which links him in Babylonian astral-theological system to the planet Mars and thus to both the Greek war god ARES and the Latin MARS. He is also connected to warlike demigod HERACLES (HERCULES). Nergal’s chief temple at Cuthah bore the name Meslam, from which the god receives the designation of MESLAMTAEDA or MESLAMTAEA, ‘the one that rises up from Meslam’. The name Meslamtaeda/Meslamtaea indeed is found as early as the list of gods from Fara while the name Nergal begins to appear only in the Akkadian period. He is linked to the Kassites’ god NUSKU. The cult of Nergal does not appear to have spread as widely as that of Ninurta, and though he is frequently invoked in Babylonia and Assyria, his role as a god of the dead may have made him feared rather than worshipped

NERTHUS
Origin: Germanic
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: NERTHA
A very early Germanic fertility goddess and earth mother still worshipped in Roman times: Tacitus recorded that she lived on an island, probably in the Baltic, being worshipped in a temple in the centre of a sacred grove. The historian also notes that she was worshipped by seven tribes, including the Angles, who later invaded Britain. He names her TERRA MATER, or Earth Mother, a goddess of fertility and growth. The Romans gave her a festival, the Fordicia, on April 15. She occasionally visits her people, riding across the waters in a chariot drawn by cows, and during her visit (discerned by her priests) there is no war or fighting, just peace and rejoicing. All iron objects must be hidden. Darkly, though, when she returns to the water, servants are required to wash her chariot and, having done so, are drowned as propitiation. She is closely linked etymologically with NJORD: scholars have suggested that mythically she may be the unnamed sister with whom Njord sired FREYR and FREYJR. She may have links to NEHALENNIA. She may also have a connection to the names ERDA and ERCE, FRAU or FRU GAUE, FRAU HOLDA, HLUODANA and LYTIR
