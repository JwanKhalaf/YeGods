Origin: Hinduism
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: JAGANNATHA
Jagannath, 'Lord of the World/Universe', is a deity widely worshipped in India's north-eastern states and in Bangladesh, though his centre of worship is in the temple city of Puri in Odisha where, once a year, a 16-wheeled wagon is rolled through the streets of Puri. His origins lie in mystery and neither he nor his worship conforms to Hindu norms. Embraced by conventional Hinduism, he is considered a form of VISHNU or his avatar KRISHNA, and is sometimes treated as the ninth avatar in place of BUDDHA. He is worshipped as part of a triad with his brother BALABHADRA (Krishna's older brother) and sister SUBHADRA, together known as the 'Ratnavedi' or 'jewelled platform'. In imagery, Jagannath is a carved and decorated wooden stump with large round eyes and with stumps as hands. He has no legs. Unlike most other Hindu deities, his icons are generally made of wood. He has no clear Vedic reference and is not a member of the traditional Dashavatara concept or the standard Hindu pantheon of major deities. He is the source of the English 'juggernaut'

JAHWEH
Origin: Semitic: Judeo-Christian
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases:	JEHOVAH, JHWH, EL OLAM
The Jews’ national god, a supreme and single deity, whose name appears to have South Semitic or Arabic origins, specifically from Edom, south of ancient Judah. In Hebrew, the name means 'he creates (or causes to be)' or simply 'lord', but Arabic forms suggest an association with storms. He may also have been a moon god. His name is first mentioned as a place name in Egyptian scripts from 1400-1200BC, but he seems to have been imported into Canaanite/Hebrew territory by the unifier king Saul, a Gibeonite whose tribe had roots in Edom. His consort for many centuries was ASHERAH. As EL OLAM he is 'The Everlasting'. The name Jahweh comes from the formation of the Hebrew letters JHWH, a combination of supposedly unpronounceable syllables known as the Tetragrammaton, designed to indicate that God should not be named. Early translators of the Bible into English erroneously made this Jehovah, and under this name he is still widely known. In the Old Testament  Jahweh/Jehovah appears variously as J. Nissi ('Lord my banner'), J. Raah ('Lord shepherd'), J. Rapha ('Lord who heals'), L. Shammah ('Lord is there'), J Tsidkenu ('Lord of righteousness'), J Mekoddishkem ('Lord who sanctifies you'), J. Jireh ('Lord will provide'), J. Shalom ('Lord of peace'), J Sabaoth ('Lord of hosts'). In the worship of Jahweh, monotheism reached its most refined form, though Egypt’s ATON (ATUN) was, as far as we know, the first and very brief focus of a truly monotheistic belief

JANUS
Origin: Etruscan, Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
Janus’s origins may be in Thessaly, Greece, though unusually he has no Greek equivalent. HERMES may share Janus’s ability to look into the past and future, the wisdom of foresight and hindsight, in his manifestations as HERMATHENA, HERMAPHRODITUS and so on; these amalgams are also displayed as two-faced, one looking forwards, the other back.  In the earliest depictions, however, he has four faces, not two, perhaps an indication that he was concerned with the four seasons or the four points of the compass. As a proto-deity he shared a kingdom with CAMESE in pre-Roman Latium, a semi-mythical kingdom south east of Rome whose capital was Alba Longa.  Janus and Camese had several children, the most notable of whom was TIBERINUS, tutelary god of the river Tiber. In the seventh century BC the Etruscans and Latins were competing for control of central Italy; but by the second century BC both Rome and Etruria worshipped him, the Romans as Janus, the Etruscans as ANI. For both he was the god of time, space, and passage, the guardian of roadways and gates. He is the god of planting, of harvest, of marriages and of births: beginnings. He was responsible in sexual union for 'opening the doorway' so that SATURN's regenerative seed could be sown, a capacity he shares with MUTUNUS TUTUNUS, INUUS and PERTUNDA.   His consort is JANA. He is linked to the Roman state god QUIRINUS as a god of peace. One of his titles is PATER MATUTINUS, ‘father of the morning’ a reverence which suggests he is the most ancient of gods, the god of gods, Creator, and makes him a correlate of MATUTA, the goddess of the morning. The Roman Janus pursued the nymph CARNA and, having caught her, granted her patronage of door and gate hinges. In his aspect of J. Consiuius, ‘the Sower’, he married another nymph, JUTURNA, goddess of springs and their child is FONS/FONTUS.  He is also named as the husband of VENILA, a goddess of shallow seas, who in other legends is NEPTUNE’s spouse. He had numerous temples in Rome and the Tiber valley but perhaps his best known is the massive double-gated structure near the Forum Romanum, through which the legions traditionally marched to war. The gates remained open while Rome was at war, and were closed only when the Empire was at peace, which wasn’t often.  A shrine and spring to Juturna can be found nearby. Other temples were at the Forum Olitorium and the Forum Nerva. His names include Janus Bifrons, the ‘two faced’, J Patulcius (the opened gate during war) and J Clusivus (the closed door during peace)

JESUS
Origin: Judaism, Christianity
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: AGNUS DEI, CHRIST, LAMB OF GOD, JESHUA, JESH'UA, MESSIAH
Very little is known about the historical Jesus, though he was almost certainly a real person, a Jew born, or at least living most of his life, in Nazareth, in the Lower Galilee area of northern Israel. Tradition says his (adoptive) father Joseph was a carpenter and that Jesus learned this trade from Joseph. Born 4-7AD, there is inconclusive and theologically controversial evidence that he was the eldest of a large family that included at least three 'natural' brothers and probably as many sisters. He is described in the New Testament, a historically unreliable document, as a rabbi, or Jewish teacher. At some stage in his late twenties or early thirties he became convinced he had an evangelical mission which, as far as analysis of surviving texts can tell us, involved a reinterpretation and extension of Torah, the Hebrew law, not as rote, but as a proactive way of living. This was theologically though not politically revolutionary. It predated rabbinical revisions following the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, centre of Judaism, in 70AD,  though it is unlikely this new teaching was the principal cause of his execution by the Roman authorities in about 40AD. Far more likely is that his death came about because either he or his disciples began to consider and act upon the notion that he was the 'messiah' who would liberate the Jews from Roman rule and set up the 'kingdom of God' with Jerusalem the global capital of an evil-free new world. Jesus may have suggested he was of Davidic descent to reinforce his claim to messiahship; it looks certain his followers believed this, either during his life or shortly after his death. This would have been a claim of much more import to the Romans, since, had it been taken seriously by large numbers of Jews, would have led to a serious threat of insurrection. Jesus's name has been Hellenised; a more accurate English rendering would be Jesh’ua, or Yesh'ua, the same root as the name Joshua. The Islamic world sees him as a premier prophet and he is revered in many other religions worldwide, though it is Christianity exclusively that equates him with the supreme God. One of the few deities believed to live ‘within’ the adherent as a real presence, and one of the few to offer salvation (ie, transfer to an exalted, eternal state) in a life after death, these attributes were attached by Paul of Tarsus, a Romanised Jew and fervent anti-Semite who persecuted the Jewish followers of Jesus both before and after a moment of enlightenment on the road to Damascus. It is almost entirely through St Paul’s efforts that Jesus became divine, immortal and an aspect of the supreme deity, anointed as the ‘Christ’. His names and titles include: the MESSIAH, CHRIST, SAVIOUR, LAMB OF GOD (AGNUS DEI). His sign - used widely among early Christians and revived by evangelical Christians this century - is the fish. This comes from the Greek ICHTHYS or, acronymically, Iesous Christos, Theou Yios, Soter, or 'Jesus Christ, God's son, saviour'. In Gnostic thought, Jesus was the third Aeon, AUTOGENES, brought into being by the First, variously known as THE GOD, the INVISIBLE, the HOLY SPIRIT, who also brought into being the Second, BARBELO, the female mirror of himself, thus creating a primal triad of Aeons - Holy Spirit, Barbelo and Jesus -  out of which the others emanated

During harvesting, some stalks of the crops are bent to the ground and secured in that location with stones. On his holy day, Mikeli, there was a ritual called the Catching of Jumis. Another ritual, called Jumja kersana, involves a procession, carrying some grains that symbolise a 'captured' Jumis to the home, thereby ensuring the following year’s harvest will be at least as successful. He is depicted as a short man with clothes that resemble ears of wheat, hops and barley. He is linked with various earth goddesses, such as LAUKA(U) MATE (Mother of the Fields), LINU MATE (Mother of the Flax) and MIEZA MATE (Mother of the Barley)

Jupiter is the Greek equivalent of ZEUS, ruler of the gods, and is the Romans’ god of the sky, thunder and lightning. He appears in the Etruscan pantheon as TIN or TINIA and is the equivalent of the Oscans’ DIUUEI.

TONANSOR or I. TONITRUALIS, the thunderer, and I. PLUUIUS, god of rain.  He is the son of SATURN and brother of NEPTUNE, PLUTO and JUNO, who (see above) is also his wife. His attribute is the lightning bolt and his symbol the eagle, which is also his messenger. He is also considered the patron god of Rome, and his temple was the official place of state business and sacrifices.
