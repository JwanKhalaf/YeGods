In Luwian and probably Hittite pantheons, Tarhun was the supreme deity, protector of the kingship, ambassador of his country, and victory-bringer in war. In Hattic he was called TARU and to the Hurrianss, before absorption into the Tarhun cult, TESHUB or TESHUP, where he was master of storms. The name TEISHEBA/TEIŠEBA and its variant THEISPAS can be traced back to the Urartu tribes (pre-Hittite), to whom he was the weather god. Throughout Asia Minor he is associated with the sacred bull and appears attended by a pair of bulls, standing on the back of a bull, or travelling over mountains in a bull-drawn chariot. He carries a handful of thunderbolts. His spouse is the sun-goddess WURUSEMU in Hattic, HUBA to the Hurrians, called ARINNITTI (from her patron city) by the Hittites, and elsewhere HEBAT, the queen of heaven, by whom he fathered SHARRUMA. With Arinnitti his children were the weather-gods TELEPINU and NERIK, and the goddesses MEZZULLA and HULLA. Tarhun is linked with the Assyrian storm-god ADAD and Aramaean (North Semitic) gods HADAD/ RAMMAN/ RIMMON.

The 'chthonic 'god of the mound' of ancient Egypt. His name means 'risen land' or 'exalted earth' referring to the silt of the Nile, but he is also the inspiration for the later pyramids, artificial 'mounds'. His father is the creator-god KHNUM, and he too is a creator god, arising from the watery chaos to represent the Earth and all its produce – plants, and minerals - which were seen to have arisen from the deep regions beneath the Earth. His nature is androgynous: in early Egyptian literature he is said to have been both 'creator and mother who gave birth to all gods' and later, 'father to all the gods'. He is an aspect of the earth-god GEB and assists the dead on their journey to the afterlife. He merges with PTAH as Ptah-Tatenen in the Old Kingdom Memphite tradition. He is always depicted in human form, usually seated with a pharaonic beard, wearing eitehr an atef-crown (as Ptah-SOKAR) or, more often, a pair of ram's horns surmounted by a sun-disc and two tall feathers. As stand-alone Tanenu he carries two snakes on his head and is sometimes depicted with a green face, denoting his chthonic, fertility and vegetation attributes

Aliases: TAWARET, TAWRET, TAURT, TUAT, TAOURIS, TUART, TAWERET, TWERT, TAUERET, THOUERIS, TOERIS, IPET, OPET, RERET, HEDJET
The decision here is to link Taweret with ancient Egypt's other hippopotamus goddesses IPET, RERET and HEDJET because there exists no definitive evidence to suggest they were anything other than aspects of the same deity, from different parts of Egypt and different periods. Worship of hippopotamus goddesses can be traced back to the Old Kingdom (c 2686-2181BC) through to the Roman period (c 332-390BC). Taweret (the name means a placatory 'she who is great') was initially seen as the epitome of chaos and danger; early Egyptians interpreted the Nile hippopotamus's violent and aggressive behaviour as something to conquer in the name of the pharaoh. But the deity quickly metamophosed into a household goddess of childbrith and fertility, reflecting the female's earnest protection of its young. She is depicted as bipedal with pendulous human breasts and large belly, but with feline characteristics – the legs and arms of a lion – and a Nile crocodile's back. This appearance was meant to frighten off any spirits that might be harmful to the child. She was often depicted holding the Sa, an amulet symbolizing protection. As a protective deity of childbirth, she was often depicted in the company of the dwarf god BES, who had a similar function. Tawret was the most popular among ordinary Egyptians as a protectress. Pregnant women commonly wore amulets bearing the goddess’s image. Ipet means 'The Nurse', Reret 'The Sow'. The meaning of Hedjet is debatable

Tecciztecatl competed with NATAUATL for the title of fifth sun after the previous four had been destroyed – consecutively by water, tigers, fiery rain and a wind storm. The gods arranged a fire and asked the two to leap into its flames. The humble Natauatl did so, but Tecciztecatl hesitated before doing so. Both burned brightly, but the gods, offended by the thought of two suns, honoured Natauatal's bravery and threw a rabbit into Tecciztecatl's face, darkening it. He thus became the moon

Category: Deity
Aliases: TERRA, TERRA MATER
An ancient grain goddess, possibly the equivalent of the Etruscan CEL, later associated with OPS, CERES and MAIA in agricultural and fertility rituals in the republican era (509-27BC), after which she is most often called TERRA (EARTH) or TERRA MATER (Earth Mother), remaining responsible for crop growth and fertility. In these later times her identity blurs with that of the Greeks' GAEA and she is paired with a 'heaven' god CAELUS (URANUS) or a form of JUPITER, and is often identified with CYBELE.She has authority over the dead, and in that aspect her name was used to curse enemies; the captured from opposing armies were deemed her legitimate sacrifices. One source says she was invoked during earthquakes. Her festivals are January 24, April 15 and December 13. Rarely, her male counterparts are TELLUMO or TELLURIS. She is depicted reclining, holding a bunch of flowers or fruit. See also MAGNA MATER

Aliases: TANRI, TNGRI, TURĂ, ASPANDIAT, ULGREN
One of the oldest, if not the oldest, of the Indo-European supreme deities, whose attributes and in most instances a form of his name, spread across Europe and even as far as Japan. The Sky-father, or god of heaven, he is first depicted as a pure white goose, flying endlessly over water, the water representing Time. AK ANA, the 'White Mother', calls to him to create the world, and he creates ER KISHI as an assistant. Between them they create the earth and everything in it. Mother Earth is EJE or GAZAR EEJ. But Er Kishi becomes demonic. In modern Turkey he is known as TANRI and is synonymous with the Abrahamic GOD and the Islamic ALLAH. In the Chuvash religion (central Russia, from the Volga region into Siberia) he is TURĂ. To the Persians he is ASPANDIAT. He is the same as DYEUS, the Indo-European sky-god. To the Mongolians he is TNGRI, a weather spirit whose homage sites are cairns marking high points and routes across the steppes. See also YER TANRI, AY TANRI. To the Buryat people of Siberia he is master of the 54 good spirits of the West, under the kingship of ESEG(E) MALAN. The Yakut people of Siberia call him ULGEN, the 'white master creator'

TEZCATLIPOCA
Origin: the Toltec people of Mexico
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases:	HURAKAN, HURACAN, YOALLI EHECATL, YAOTL, TELPOCHTLI
One of the major deities of the northern Toltecs, he was brought to central Mexico in about 1000AD. By 1600AD he had supplanted the Aztecs’ QUETZALCOATL as their supreme god. He seems to have gained and maintained power through a regime of powerful black magic, which involved human sacrifice, particularly of young people, by which he maintained his own eternal youth. He was wise, all-seeing and the protector of young men, warriors and slaves, punishing wrongdoers by sending them sickness, poverty or slavery. His constellation was the Great Bear, and his dwelling place the night sky, specifically the north. His nagual, or spirit-twin animal disguise, was the jaguar, and he is often represented as having a black stripe painted across his face. In some illustrations a mirror replaces one foot; in others, the mirror is on his chest. His name means ‘That which causes the black mirror to shine’. He is a creator god, said to have ruled over the first of four universes that existed before our present one. In Guatamala after 900AD he was worshipped as a storm, whirlwind and lightning god under the name HURAKAN or Huracan, from which we derive the word ‘hurricane’. His nickname was One-leg, one of three lightning and creation gods together called 'Heart of the Sky'. Under the name of Hurakan his worship spread around much of the Caribbean Basin. He associated with GUCUMATZ and TEPEU in the Mayan pantheon in their second and third creations, building sentient creatures from wood and later from maize. He is said to have given humans the gift of fire. Tezcatlipoca was also known as YOALLI EHECATL (Night Wind), YAOTL (Warrior), and TELPOCHTLI (Young Man). Principal sites of worship were the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and in the Mixteca-Peubla region. He is the equivalent of the Yucatan HUNAB-KU
