Origin: Greek
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
The daughter of SCHEONEUS of Boeotia, or of IASUS and CLYMENE of Arcadia. She is a swift-footed huntress whose attributes mark her as a regional manifestation of ARTEMIS. Her husband was HIPPOMENES (or MELANION, or MEILANION). Their son was PARTHENOPAEUS, who joined the expedition of the Seven Against Thebes. Disappointed that she was not a boy, her father abandoned her on a mountainside shortly after her birth. She was rescued and nursed by a she-bear and later raised by hunters. By the time she had grown up, she was a skilled hunter herself. The feat for which she became especially famous was her participation in the boar hunt of Calydon, a city of Aetolia in central Greece. According to another legend, Atalanta was a fleet-footed runner who offered to marry anyone who could defeat her in a race. Those who lost were killed. The youth Hippomenes (or Melanion) won with the aid of APHRODITE, goddess of love, who gave him three golden apples of the Hesperides. He dropped them one by one, and, by stopping to pick them up, Atalanta lost the race. She and Hippomenes were later turned into lions because of an affront to the gods: they had sex in a temple

ATARGATIS
Origin: Western Semitic
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: DEA SYRIA, ASTRES
The Great Mother Goddess of Northern Syria, the DEA SYRIA, the ‘Lady of Life’, she was linked with ASTARTE of the Phoenician pantheon. Her major Syrian cult centres were at Kherbet Tannur, where she is a vegetation goddess, and at Kherbet Brak, where she is associated with dolphins. She is also known as DERKETO at her worship centre at Ascalon. Her symbol is a fish, or a pole or tree trunk, and many of her sanctuaries included a fish-pond. There are similarities and links with the Anatolian CYBELE. Her chief sanctuary was at Hierapolis/Bambyce, modern Mambij, from where twice yearly her statue and that of storm god HADAD/ADAD were carried to the sea. Her first consort is DUSARA, but later she became linked with Hadad/Adad. Her worship was spread by Greek merchants and became synonymous with that of APHRODITE and later, VENUS. Roman citizens comprised most of her worshippers at her shrine at Delos, where a statue of her was consecrated for the wellbeing of Rome in 118/117BCE. At Eryx in Sicily she was identified with Punic ASTARTE, also identified with ISHTAR/INNANA, and at ceremonies her sacred prostitutes played the role of Dido, while Roman consuls and generals played Aeneas. The Etruscans worshipped her as ASTRES. There is a link between Atargatis and the lunar AL-LAT(H)/AL-UZZA of the Nabataeans of south Palestine, whose centre was Petra, and some authorities identify her as the chief goddess of Arabia, her principal temple being the Ka’abah. The emperor Nero revered her and thus brought her worship to the centre of the Roman Empire, where she was invested as VENUS Erycina (from Eryx). Her temple on the Capitoline dedicated April 23, after the Roman defeat by Hannibal at Lake Trasimene, 217 BCE. Lucian’s Ode 43 is dedicated to Dea Syria. Her chief attributes were her control over fertility, her ability to protect cities, and her power over nature. Her symbols include a cornucopaea (possibly linking her with TYCHE, goddess of fortune), a rudder, zodiac signs and an astral veil. She sometimes appears as half-dolphin or 'mermaid' and sometimes she is flanked by lions

ATHENA
Origin: Greek
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ATHENE, ATHENA POLIAS, ATHENA PALLAS, ATHENA NIKE, ATHENA PROMACHUS, ATHENA PARTHENOS, ALACOMENEIS, ALCIS
Popular and widespread goddess of war, handicrafts and practical reason or wisdom, from about 800BC she was a protectress of kings, priests and cities, specifically of Athens, where she carried the name Athena POLIAS, or PALLAS ATHENA. Her origins are almost certainly pre-Hellenic: she is similar in many ways to ARTEMIS. Uniquely in the Greek pantheon, she has neither consort nor offspring. She is depicted as a virgin, having had a miraculous birth, springing forth in full armour from ZEUS’ forehead. In some legends this is the result of an axe-blow from HEPHAESTUS. Hesiod says she is the daughter of METIS, Wisdom. Later, Hephaestus tried to take her virginity, but his seed fell on the ground, giving rise to ERICHTONIUS the snake-god. As A. Nike she is the ‘giver of victory’; as A. Alea, the protectress of Tegea; as A. Ergane, (‘working’), the goddess of industry, as A. Promachus, she is the ‘one who fights in the foremost ranks’, and as A. Parthenos she is ‘the maiden’. Her major temple, the Parthenon, was in Athens, which, according to legend, became hers as a result of her gift of the olive tree to the Athenian people. In the ceremony the Arrephoria, two maidens carried secret ritual objects from the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis to Aphrodite’s sanctuary and returned similarly burdened. One supposition is that snake symbols were swapped for phalli. Her animals are the owl, snake and heifer. The Panathanaea was Athena’s birthday ceremony, celebrating the growth of vegetation; the Procharisteria marked Athena’s rising from the ground with the coming of spring. She was eagerly accepted into the Roman pantheon as MINERVA. She is pictured in body armour and a helmet, carrying a shield adorned with the head of MEDUSA, the Gorgon, and lance or thunderbolt. As goddess of war, Athena was the strongest supporter, among the gods, of the Greek side in the Trojan War. After the fall of Troy, however, the Greeks failed to respect the sanctity of an altar to Athena at which the Trojan prophet Cassandra sought shelter. As punishment, storms sent by the god of the sea, Poseidon, at Athena's request, destroyed most of the Greek ships returning from Troy. Athena was also a patron of the agricultural arts and of the crafts of women, especially spinning and weaving. Among her gifts to man were the inventions of the plough and the flute and the arts of taming animals, building ships, and making shoes. The surname ALALCOMENEIS is derived either from ALALCOMENES, who introduced her worship, or from Alalcomenae in Boeotia, where she was believed to have been born. She is known to the Macedonians as ALCIS

A Titan, or in some legends, son of the Titan IAPETUS and the nymph CLYMENE; brother of PROMETHEUS. Homer depicts him as a Neptunian type who supports the pillars that hold heaven and earth apart. Later legends have him as a North African king, turned into a rocky mountain by PERSEUS. Hesiod says Atlas was a Titan involved in the Titanomachy, the war of the Titans against the Olympian gods, and as a punishment ZEUS obliged him to hold the heavens aloft. Atlas was the father of the Hesperides, the nymphs who guarded the tree of golden apples, and Hercules sought his help in performing one of his labours. Hercules offered to assume Atlas’s burden if Atlas would obtain the golden apples for him. Atlas happily agreed, thinking to rid himself forever of the wearying load. After Atlas returned with the apples, Hercules asked him to take the burden back for a moment while he arranged a pad to ease the pressure on his shoulders. Atlas assumed the load again, and Hercules departed with the apples

ATON
Origin: Egypt
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ATEN
From about 2000BC, the creator/sun god, usually depicted as a solar disc emitting rays which end in hands. His worship gained traction through the Late New Kingdom dynasty reigns of Amenhotep II, Tuthmosis IV and Amenhotep III, when a cult centre was established at Heliopolis. For a brief period under the king Akhenaton and Queen Nefertiti (1379-1362BC) he became the one and only invisible, intangible God replacing the sun god RE-HORAKHTE, and his worship is often cited as the first example of male monotheism. The concept was too revolutionary for the Egyptians, particularly the AMUN-RE priesthood, who abandoned Aton’s worship both at Karnak in Thebes and his purpose-built city on the east bank of the Nile (Akhetaton, now Tell el-Amarna) on Akhenaton’s death, destroying most of Aton's temples and iconography in the process

ATTIS
Origin: Greece
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ATYS
An ancient nature god, one of the earliest in the Greek pantheon to be connected to a renewal myth – probably that of the Mesopotamian DUMUZI/TAMMUZ. His worship dates from 500BC and continues until Christianisation circa 400AD. A shepherd, he is the son or consort of KYBELE/CYBELE, the Great Mother of the Gods, by whom he was driven insane. He was worshipped in Phrygia, Asia Minor and later throughout the Roman Empire, achieving solar deity status in the 2nd century AD, when his mother was installed in the Temple of Victory on the Palatine Hill. His Roman feast day was March 22, when a pine tree was carried into the Palatine Hill temple and decorated. The festival was replaced in the Christian calendar by Easter. The Phrygian original has his mother NANA, the daughter of the river SANGARIUS, who in one legend conceives him when she places a ripe almond in her cleavage. In another, his father is the bi-sexual AGDISTIS. Agdistis struck his/her son as he was about to be married, and in remorse, Attis castrated himself under a pine tree and bled to death - or, in a variation, became Cybele’s first eunuch priest. Repentant, Agdistis persuaded ZEUS to grant that Attis’s body should never decay. St Paul was well aware of the similarities between Attis and JESUS CHRIST (death linked to a tree and rebirth, Mary as Kybele)

He is depicted as either a human or a serpent, bull or lion. He is the supreme sun-god, named in the Book of the Dead as 'the Only One', living inside NU, the primordial abyss. The merger identifies him with the setting or ‘under’ sun, whereas Re is the ‘over sun’ or sun-at-zenith. Out of Atum was born SHU (‘dry air’) and TEFNUT (‘moisture’). According to the Heliopolis tradition, Atum became separated from Shu and Tefnut and on finding them, he wept with joy. The tears became human beings. From Shu and Tefnut were born GEB (the Earth) and his sister and wife NUT (the sky). To Geb and Nut were born the gods ISIS, OSIRIS, NEPHTHYS, SETH and, in some legends, HORUS
