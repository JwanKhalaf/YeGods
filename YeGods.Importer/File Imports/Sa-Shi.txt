Category: Demon
Aliases: HA-SATAN, SATARIEL, SATANIEL, SATAN'EL, DIABOLOS, DIABOLUS, SHAITAN, SHAYTAN, TAUS MALEK, LUCIFER, THE DEVIL, JINN, IBLIS
In Hebrew, Satan is a position, not an entity, and as such is named HA-SATAN, or 'The Satan'. He is 'the Adversary' or 'the Accuser'. The Hebrew Book of Enoch refers to SATARIEL, SATANIEL or SATAN'EL, an etymology dating to Babylonian times. In the Old and New Testaments, the Greek word DIABOLOS ('Slanderer') is used, and from the same word we get the English 'Devil'. Also SHAYTAN (the Yazidis of eastern Syria and northern Iraq, where he is known as TAUS MALEK, the PEACOCK ANGEL, who disobeyed God when God told his people to pray to Adam, the primal human). See also LUCIFER, the DEVIL. Islamists refer to Satan as SHAITAN, JINN or IBLIS. Iblis also refused to bow down to Adam, believing himself to be superior to humans. Adam is made of clay, he argues; I am made of fire. While fundamentalist Christians still see Satan as a real entity, many religious persuasions see him as symbolic of humanity's lower urges and tendencies; as 'evil' incarnate and a challenger for world domination in eschatalogical theology

SATURN
Origin: Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: SATURNUS, SEMINO
Saturn is a major Roman (specifically, south Italian) deity of agriculture and harvest, identified in antiquity with the Greek deity CRONUS (KRONOS), and the mythologies of the two gods are commonly mixed. Saturn’s wife is RHEA’s equivalent – not MAGNA MATER, the Great Mother. Saturn was the father of CERES, JUPITER and VERITAS, among others. Saturn had a temple on the Forum Romanum which contained the Royal Treasury. Originally, Saturn was a corn god, and in this light had a more wholesome relationship with DEMETER (Roman) or GAIA (Greek). Saturn was said to be protector of sowers and seeds. His wife, OPS, also helped the harvest. Later, as Greek culture increasingly influenced Roman religion, Saturn became associated with Cronus, the Titan and father of Jupiter. In this way, Saturn was personified, and a great number of stories came into being about him. In Hesiod’s Theogony, a mythological account of the creation of the universe and Zeus’ rise to power, Saturn is mentioned as the son of URANUS, the heavens, and Gaia, the earth. Saturn seizes power, castrating and overthrowing his father Uranus. However, it was foretold that one day a mighty son of Saturn would in turn overthrow him, and Saturn devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this. Saturn’s wife, Ops, hid her sixth child on the island of Crete, and offered Saturn a large stone wrapped in swaddling clothes in his place. Jupiter later overthrew Saturn and the other Titans, becoming the new supreme ruler of the cosmos. In memory of the Golden Age of man, a mythical age when Saturn was said to have ruled, a great feast called Saturnalia was held during the winter months around the time of the winter solstice. It was originally only one day long, taking place on December 17, but later lasted one week. During Saturnalia, roles of master and slave were reversed, moral restrictions lessened, and the rules of etiquette ignored

Goddess known as The Powerful One, she is a lioness goddess, daughter of RA. In Memphis she formed part of the Memphite triad together with PTAH as her consort and NEFERTUM (otherwise the son of BASTET) as her son. She is depicted either as a lioness or in human form with the head of a lioness. She was generally shown crowned by the solar disk, holding the Ankh (life) symbol or a sceptre in the shape of a papyrus reed. In Thebes Sekhmet came to be combined with MUT, the consort of the Theban sun god AMUN. A warrior goddess, she was said to breathe fire at the enemies of the Pharaoh. Like the goddess HATHOR, Sekhmet could become the ‘eye of Ra,’ an agent of the sun god’s punishment. She was believed to be the bearer of plague and pestilence, but in a more benign aspect she was called upon in spells and amulets to ward off disease

Selene enjoyed a long popularity with the Greeks and was accepted without hesitation into the Roman pantheon as LUNA, where she had temples on the Roman hills of the Aventine and Palatine. She is the personification of the moon, and was worshipped at the new and full moons. Her parents were the Titans HYPERION and THEIA and her brother - sometimes her father - was HELIOS/SOL. Her sister was EOS (Dawn) and her husband ZEUS. She fell in love with ENDYMION and ZEUS banished him to eternal sleep on Mount Latmus, where Selene secretly visited him, and where they had 50 daughters. In minor legends she is said to have been the lover of PAN. By the fifth century BC she was being linked with PHOEBE and ARTEMIS, both goddesses with lunar connections. She is depicted as riding in a two-horse chariot, with a crescent moon headdress. Also known as MENE

Category: Deity
Aliases: ZEMELÔ
The cult of DYONYSOS/SEMELE pre-dates the Thracian occupation of Asia Minor and was adopted enthusiastically by the Thracian/Phrygian culture. Semele may by Mycenean in origin. In Phrygia her name was ZEMELÔ. Her cult was then adapted by the Greek colonists and penetrated Greek mythology, and then later by Rome. It's now difficult to detect the original nature of the goddess, other than to strongly suggest the name comes from a word meaning 'earth': she might thus be a nature or fertility goddess. The Greeks have her as the daughter of the Boetian king CADMUS and HARMONICA. She is impregnated by ZEUS and gives birth to Dionysos. After the Roman takeover she becomes synonymous with the Roman goddess STIMULA

The name derives from ASER-HAPI, or OSIRIS-APIS, and is a political invention of Ptolemy I of Egypt following the Greek conquest in the third century BC. The idea was to unify Greek and Egyptian worship, so Serapis is Greek in appearance, but with many of the trapping of Egyptian gods, icons chosen to represent abundance and resurrection. Temples and religious precincts were built all over the empire, the largest being the Serapeum in Alexandria. The worship of Serapis continued well into the Roman period, and he often replaces OSIRIS as the consort of ISIS in temples outside Egypt. Serapis survived well into the Christian era, though a Christian mob destroyed the Alexandrian temple in AD389, and Emperor Theodosius abolished the cult in 391

SEVEN AGAINST THEBES
Origin: Early Greek
Sex: M
Category: Hero
Aliases: ADRASTUS, AMPHIARAUS, CAPANEUS, HIPPOMEDON, PARTENOPEUS. POLYNEIKES, TYDEUS
According to the rather simplistic play by Aeschylus, when OEDIPUS stepped down as King of Thebes, he gave the kingdom to his two sons, Eteocles and Polynices (Polyneikes), who agreed to alternate the throne every year. After the first year, Eteocles refused to step down and Polynices attacked Thebes with his Seven supporters. Seven captains defend the city, and each is killed by the other, brothers Eteocles asnd Polynices being the last to die at each other’s hand. The theme may predate the Trojan War, placing it in the Bronze Age, and may indeed be borrowed from an Akkadian epic text in which ERRA the plague god sends seven demons to destroy Babylon (mankind). The Seven Against Thebes were Adrastus (the Inescapable, who rode a magic horse), Amphiaraus (the seer, who had his own sanctuary and cult afterwards), Capaneus, Hippomedon, Partenopeus, Polyniekes and Tydeus. Their allies were Eteoclus and Mecistus, though some sources say that these two were of the Seven, and Tydeus and Polynices were allies. In any event, all nine with the exception of Adrastus were killed in the battle. The defenders of Thebes included Creon, Megareus, Poriclymenus, Melanippus, Polyphontes, Hyperbius, Actor and Lasthenes

Shams was a female south Arabian sun-deity, common to most tribes but with local epithets describing contrasting or specific aspects of her nature. She is linked in triad with SIN, ‘AMM, WADD, ILUMQUH most popularly as AGLIBOL and ATHTAR/VENUS. There is a possibility that Shem is a separate minor deity linked to the city of Ebla (in Cana?) and that SHEM B’L (Name of Ba’al) indicates a consort relationship with Ba’al. As Shem b’l she is absorbed by ATHTART/ISHTAR

SHAMASH
Origin: Mesopotamia: Akkad
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: SAMA
The sun-god in both Babylonia and Assyria, Shamash is an Akkadian name corresponding to the Sumerian UTU. Whilst he is a pivotal god in the Babylonian/Assyrian pantheon, he is preceded in importance by moon gods, and is depicted as the offspring of NANNAR and SIN. This appears to be because the moon plays a more prominent role in the calendar and astrology of nomadic peoples than does the sun. The situation reverses as the Babylonias and Assyrians settle and become agriculture-based civilisations. Chief centres of sun-worship in Babylon were Sippar (Abu Habba ruins) and Larsa (modern (Senkerah) but temples dedicated to Shamash were in all major cities including Babylon, Ur, Mari, Nippur and Nineveh. The attribute most commonly associated with Shamash is justice. Just as the sun disperses darkness, so Shamash brings wrong and injustice to light. It was a logical consequence of this conception of the sun-god that he was regarded also as the one who released the sufferer from the grasp of the demons. The sick man, therefore, appeals to Shamash as the god who can be depended upon to help those who are suffering unjustly. At his major worhip sites, local sun-gods were ‘demoted’ and became Shamash’s servants – his chariot driver BUNENE, whose consort is ATGI-MAKH; KETTU (‘Justice’) and MESHARU (‘Right’). Other sun-deities, as NINURTA and NERGAL, the patron deities of important centres, retained their independent existence as certain phases of the sun, NINIB becoming the sun-god of the morning and of the spring time, and Nergal the sun-god of the noon and of the summer solstice, while Shamash was viewed as the sun-god in general. Together with Sin and ISHTAR, Shamash forms a second triad by the side of ANU, ENLIL and EA. The three powers, Sin, Shamash and Ishtar, symbolised the three great forces of nature, the sun, the moon and the life-giving force of the earth. At times, instead of Ishtar, we find ADAD, the storm-god, associated with Sin and Shamash, and it may be that these two sets of triads represent the doctrines of two different schools of theological thought in Babylonia which were subsequently harmonised by the recognition of a group consisting of all four deities. Shamash’s consort was the mother-goddess AYA, who developed from the Sumerians' ŠERIDA She, however, is rarely mentioned in the inscriptions except in combination with Shamash. Interestingly, the central branch of the Judaic candlestick or menorah is called Shamash, perhaps echoing some tribal memory. The name ‘Samson’ (‘Shimshun’) had the same root as Shamash, and Samson’s wild long hair may be the rays of the sun, common to most images of solar deities

SHIVA
Origin: Hinduism
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: SIVA, ŠIVA, ISHANA, NATARAJA
Male principle, symbol the lingam. He is depicted in early (pre-Aryan) Hindu art and sculpture as the Lord of the Beasts, and may indeed have been the original god of the TRIMURTI, or triad, three-god, which comprised Shiva, BRAHMA and VISHNU. He is often shown in the position of the yogi, the divine teacher, one who practises self-discipline, and appears contemplative. He often displays a third, upright eye in the centre of his forehead. In later images he is depicted half-naked, smeared in ash, with skulls around his waist and a necklace of twined serpents. He has many hands, to indicate that he holds life and death, creation and destruction, good and evil, in balance. These forms have remained largely unchanged for 5,000 years, so Shiva is probably the oldest identifiable male god still to have active worshippers. From the 12th century CE he is the ‘dancing god’, of NATARAJA, the original Lord of the Dance, an active role that reinforces his connection with cosmic energy, fertility and procreation. The Nataraja role is that of destroyer of the universe, paradoxically a creative act, since he clears the way for Brahma to recreate it afresh. He dances on APASMAPURUSA or APARASMA, the demon or dwarf of ignorance. He is also the master of combining all opposites, of reuniting the separated. In most temples dedicated to him there is a statue of a bull, symbol of virility. Some statues depict him being worshipped by two sages, one with the lower body of a snake, the other with that of a tiger. His consort is MAHADEVI SHAKTI, his wife (or another manifestation of Mahadevi Shakti) is PARVATI, though in some areas his consort can be either DURGA or KALI. His sacred mountain is Mount Kailish in Tibet. One aspect of him is ISHANA, guardian deity of the north east, a guardianship he shares with SOMA
