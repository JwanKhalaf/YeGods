Origin: Egypt
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: HETHERT, ATHYR
Cow goddess. A goddess of love and motherhood, worshipped from about 2700BC to AD400. Hathor is the daughter of NUT and RE/RA. In early Egyptian mythology she was said to be the mother of HORUS, but was later displaced by ISIS. After being displaced, Hathor became a protectress or consort of Horus (at Dandara). The Greeks identified Hathor with APHRODITE. Her name means House (or Mansion) of Horus, referring to her role as a sky goddess. The heavens were often depicted as being a cow with stars on it. She was often regarded as the mother of the Pharaoh, who called himself the Son of Hathor. Since the Pharaoh was also considered to be the Living Horus, as the son of Isis, it is plausible that the phrase ‘son of Hathor’ came from when Hathor was the mother of Horus.  The snake, the Egyptian rattle known as the sistrum, and the papyrus reed often symbolised Hathor. Her image could also be used to form the capitals of columns in Egyptian architecture. Her principal sanctuary and possibly place of origin is at Dandara, where she is mainly worshipped as a goddess of fertility, women and childbirth. At Thebes she was regarded as a goddess of the dead with the title of ‘Lady of the West.’ At the temple dedicated to Horus at Edfu a distinct tradition has her Horus's consort. As 'Lady of the West' she is associated with Ra on his descent below the western horizon and various deaths related gods, such as OSIRIS and ANUBIS. She is depicted either as a cow or in human form wearing a crown consisting of a sun disk held between the horns of a cow. At Byblos she is associated with ISIS. She is also  the goddess of alcohol and erotic dance. Her symbols are the lion, papyrus reeds and snakes

HELEN
Origin: Greek
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: None
In Greek myth, and passed from there into Western classical thought, Helen is the most beautiful woman in the world – ever. She is the daughter of Zeus and LEDA, and therefore wholly divine. Hesiod has her the daughter of Zeus and OCEAN. Other writers have her mother as NEMESIS. Her (semi-divine; qv) sister is CLYTEMNESTRA and her twin brothers are the Dioscuri, CASTOR and POLLUX. Legends concerning her youth say she is abducted by, or elopes with, THESEUS, and in some accounts bears him a child. After a competition among her many suitors, during which all swear an oath to supply military help should Helen be abducted, she marries the victor MENELAUS, king of Laconia. While married she is abducted by PARIS, prince of Troy, and this act brings about the Trojan War.  It's not clear whether Helen willingly submits to this abduction; Homer suggests it is willingly, but that she comes to regret her choice and wishes to be reunited with Menelaus. Other accounts suggest she revels in the war. Paris is killed in action and Helen is reunited with Menelaus, though Homer has her ascending directly to Olympus. Her cult centre is in Sparta, in Hellenistic Laconia. At Therapne she shares a shrine with Menelaus. Her worship is detected in Attica and also on the island of Rhodes, where she is known as DENDRITIS

HERACLES
Origin: Greek, then Roman
Sex: M
Category: Hero
Aliases: HERAKLES, HERCULES, HERCLE, HERKLE, ALCIDES
One of classical Greece's most popular heroes, a hunter and strong man who beats impossible odds, human and divine, with courage and persistence, yet whose mortal defects secure him a place even in modern sympathies. He is linked with solar worship, a ‘hero of physical strength’. His twin is IPHICLES; the mother of both is ALCMENE, but Heracles is the son of ZEUS, while Iphicles is the son of the mortal AMPHITRON, so Heracles, unlike his brother, is a demigod. In Greek times his consort was DEIANEIRA. His earliest manifestation as a shaman to whom one applies for successful hunting is probably modelled on much earlier Near Eastern culture: MJ suggests the characteristics of NINURTA. Heracles' worship arrived in Italy in pre-Roman times, worshipped by the Oscans as HEREKLEIS and by the Etruscans HERKLE, but unlike the Hercules of Greek myth he married MINERVA and fathered MARIS. In Rome he became a guardian of vows as SANCUS, or DIUS FIDIUS, and a provider of nourishing food for infants. A festival on August 12-13 named him H. Victor, or H. Invictus; he was honoured on June 4 as H. Custos and was also honoured at H. Defensor.  In Britain worship is found at Silchester, where he was H. Saegon. In north eastern France he appears as H Magusanus and in Narbonensis, southern France, as H Ilunnus. At Rome his Ara Maxima was in the Forum Boarum

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ACACETUS, ATLANTIADES
Messenger of the gods (principally of ZEUS), as was his counterpart MERCURY of the Romans and TURMS of the Etruscans. Like Turms, he is also the conductor of souls to the underworld. He is the son of ZEUS and MAIA and the consort of APHRODITE. He is the patron of heralds and wayfarers, of luck, music and eloquence, of commerce and young men, and of cheats and thieves, of boundaries and graves and shepherds. He characteristically carries a caduceus, or staff with twined twigs at the end, as a warning that he is a sacred person, not to be molested, and wears a wide-brimmed winged hat and winged sandals. Hermes sometimes had the sobriquet ACACETUS, denoting his eloquence. He is credited with having invented the lyre, fire and the shepherd’s flute and he is a notable and competent thief, used by the other gods of Olympus. His most typical monument, the herma or herm, was a stone pillar which usually had a carved head on top and a phallus in the centre, probably representing the god in his original role as the giver of fertility. The Hermaea, a riotous festival, was celebrated in his honour. A famous statue by Praxiteles, in the Heraeum at Olympia, Greece, shows Hermes with the child DIONYSUS. The subriquet Atlantiades may also refer to ATLAS
