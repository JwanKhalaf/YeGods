God of the changing seasons, plant growth and the ripening of fruit and grain. Vertumnus, originally VOLTUMNA, the chief god of the Etruscans was introduced at Rome by an ancient Vulsinian colony. The name signifies ‘the god who changes or metamorphoses himself.’ For this reason the Romans connected Vertumnus with all occurrences to which the verb verto applies, such as the change of seasons, purchase and sale, the return of rivers to their proper beds, etc. But in reality the god was connected only with the transformation of plants, and their progress from being in blossom to that of bearing fruit.

Category: Deity
Aliases: None
Three Romano-Celtic inscriptions found at Essarois, Côte d'Or, eastern France, identify Vindonnus as having some of the attributes of the Romans' APOLLO, particularly of healing. No depictions of the god appear to have survived. Reconstructions of his name suggest windo (white) as being an element, this element often in Celtic mythology associated with 'blessed', hence 'the blessed one'

VINOTONUS
Origin: Celtic Britain
Sex: M

Aliases: None
It is suspected that Vinotonus is a wilderness god similar to the Roman SILVANUS, with whom he is associated in the Celto-Roman mythological exchange. Only seven altars dedicated to him have been found, all of them on the Yorkshire Moors in the UK. This would suggest that 'god of the vines' is an inappropriate translation of his name! He was worshipped from about 100BC to AD500

VIRACOCHA
Origin: South America: the Inca people
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: HUIRACOCHA
The supreme Inca deity, described as ‘the ancient lord, instructor of the world, creator.’ A god of the sun and storm, he created mankind by breathing life into painted stone dolls, reflecting the Incas’ belief that man was, at heart, living rock. The term Viracocha is thought to mean ‘foam of the sea’. Viracocha was pale-skinned and white-bearded (unlike the people for whom he was god), wore sandals and a long robe, and carried a staff. The Incas greeted the invading Spaniards with cries of ‘Viracocha!’ and it is assumed their belief that their deity had returned in human form resulted in a weakened resistance to the subsequent rape and subjugation of their land. Viracocha was, according to their beliefs, capable of infinite self-duplication. He was worshipped also by the Huari and the Chavin tribes as a distant relative of their sky god

VIRADECHTHIS

Sex: M
Category: Hero
Aliases: None
An ancient mythical king of Aricia and a favourite of DIANA, who, when he died, called on AESCLEPIUS to raise him to life and entrusted him to the care of the nymph AEGERIA. The fact of his being a favourite of Diana, the Taurian goddess, seems to have led the Romans to identify him with HIPPOLYTUS who, according to some traditions, had established the worship of Diana

VIRGIN MARY
Origin: Christianity
Sex: F
Category: Hero
Aliases: MOTHER OF GOD, BLACK VIRGIN
In the Bible the Virgin Mary is the mother of Jesus. The word ‘virgin’ has inaccurate modern connotations. The Aramaic really means ‘woman of marriageable age’. The Gospel writers take pains to trace her son’s - and therefore her - ancestry back to the House of David and even to Adam ostensibly to establish the legitimacy of Christ’s claim to be of royal/human blood. Mary is made pregnant by the Holy Spirit under the aegis of an angel, and thus earns her title Virgin. Since on his Father’s side Jesus is the Son of God, the legitimacy of his mother is supremely important. She is mythologised from the earliest Church writings, and soon assumes the mantle and characteristics of mother goddesses the world over. Her titles include The Mother of God, Our Lady of the Water/Nettles/Briars/Mounds/ and Pines. She is also the Black Virgin. Most of the cathedrals of which she is patron are built on pagan sites, and in some (ie Chartres) secret worship of the Virgin in crypts beneath the cathedral retained pre-Christian elements throughout the Middle Ages. It is no surprise that Catholics will pray to the Mother to ask her to intercede on their behalf with her Son

VIRIDIUS

One of the TRIMURTI, the great triad of Hindu gods including BRAHMA the creator and SHIVA the destroyer. In this context he is the preserver, particularly of the power of nature and of human life. In his Vedic aspect of TRI-VIKRAMA he is the conqueror of the three worlds that constitute the universe. He is in charge of human destiny and acts as the balance between good and evil. He is depicted reclining or asleep on the ocean, quelling its unpredictability, mastering its chaos, and holding in check the ocean’s 1,000-headed serpent. He is a solar deity, originally, and is sometimes depicted mounted on the heavenly eagle GARUDA. With his partner LAKSHMI he is the epitome of beauty, grace and good fortune. He is worshipped as BADARANATHA in Badrinath, Pradesh State, India, where there is a temple. In southern India his eponyms include VENKATA and VENKATESHWARA. There are 10 avatars of Vishnu, as follows: 1. MATSYA, the Fish, who appeared at the time of the great Flood to warn humankind of the dangers it faced; 2. KURMA the Turtle, who rescued treasures from the Flood; 3. VARAHU, the Boar who raised the earth after the Flood; 4.

VISHVAKARMAN
Origin: Vedic Hinduism
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: VISHWAKARMA, TVASTAR, TVOSTAR
Outside of Hinduism, Vishvakarman's importance as the personifcation of ultimate reality and architect of the universe is underestimated. The Rigveda describes him as the engineer of pre-time and a manifestation of INDRA and the Sun, thus predating supreme god BRAHMAN. This poetry identifies Vishvakarman as all-seeing, with a multiplicity of eyes, faces, arms and feet. He is the master of prosperity, swift as thought, a seer, priest and lord of speech. He creates the divine smith TVASTAR – or Travastar is another of his manifestatuons – and both are revered by architects, builders, metalworkers and craftspeople as a consequence. He has designed chariots, weapons and attributes for all the gods and is credited with devising missiles including the Vajra, sacred weapon of Lord Indra, from the bones of the sage Dadhichi

VISUCIUS

Aliases: VISUCLUS, VISUGIUS
Visucius's homeland appears to be in eastern Gaul, around Trier, the Rhine and in Bordeaux. Roman occupation ascribed him as an epithet of MERCURY. His name may mean 'of the ravens' or 'knowledgeable'. One inscription with the name SANCTA VISUCIA suggests he may have had either a female aspect or companion-deity who, like ROSMERTA or MAIA, often accompanies Mercury. And incription found in Agoncillo, Spain reads 'Visugius'; maybe it's the same deity

VULCAN
Origin: Etruscan, then Roman
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: VULCANUS, VOLCANUS
Vulcan’s origins are ancient. He might have origins in Crete, as VELCHANOS. His Greek equivalent is HEPHAESTUS and both are gods of fire, blacksmiths and craftsmen in general. An early Etruscan form has him as Volcanus, husband of MAIESTA or MAIA, the ripener of fruit through his inner warmth – ie, a nature deity, though he is also linked with the Etruscan SETHLANS. Vulcan’s forge is located beneath Mount Etna, where he forges weapons for gods and heroes. He is closely associated with BONA DEA, with whom he shares the festival of Volcanalia on August 23. His own festival is the Tubilustrium of May 23, at which he is V. MULCIBER, ‘The Smelter’. He became one of the DII CONSENTES, the Roman ‘panel’ of paired chief deities, in 217BCE, paired with VENUS. He is a protector of smiths and is often depicted as a lame, bearded man dressed as a worker and carrying the utensils of a smith. There was a Temple of Vulcan in the Campus Martius. Vulcan was the patron of Ostia, the harbour city of Rome. He seems to have been a minor but ever-present element of legend: In Virgil’s Aeneid he makes a suit of armour for AENEAS at VENUS’s request, and made a shield and thunderbolts for Jupiter, and is rewarded with the hand of Venus in marriage
