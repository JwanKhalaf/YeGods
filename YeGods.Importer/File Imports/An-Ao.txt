ANAHIT
Origin: Armenia
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ANAHITA, GREAT LADY, GOLDEN MOTHER, GLORY
Where many deities in the Armenian pantheon are depicted as distantly powerful and impersonal, ANAHIT, goddess of springs, rivers and waters, fertility and birth, was an intimate and much-loved deity, often sculpted with a child in her arms and with the distinctive hairstyle of Armenian women. 'The Great Lady', the 'golden mother', the 'glory', is depicted as the daughter or wife of sun-god and Armenian all-father ARAMAZD. As Anahita she is technically Persian, but there's a strong suspicion among scholars that she is cognate with the Babylonian ISHTAR under the name of ANATU, or the Elamite NAHUNTA. Thanks to her adoption by the conquering Persians under Ataxerxes II her worship spread through the Persian empire, where it survived long enough to be carried into the Greek pantheon. Here she is identified with ATHENA, ARTEMIS and APHRODITE. She also turns up in Rome; a mountain in the district of Sophene was described as Anahit's throne (Ator Anahta). A peculiarity of her worship was that noble Armenian families were obliged to offer sex in her name in her temples to all who wanted it

ANAT
Origin: Syrian/Palestinian
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ANATH, ANANT, ANIT, ANTI, ANTHAT, ANTIT, ATTE
The chief Western Semitic or Canaanite goddess of hunting and war, then later love, sex and fertility, also known as ATAR(GATIS) in North Syria and Phoenicia, where her chief sanctuary was in Hieropolis-Bambyce. At Ascalon in Palestine she was known as ATTE. She is the daughter of EL and BAAL’s consort, wife or sister in Semitic tradition, a ferocious and unforgiving goddess who destroys Baal's enemies and wades in their blood. She hunts down and kills the god of death, MOT after he kills Baal, but northwards she seems to have had as consort the storm-god HADAD (ADAD), and to have been a city-protectress and nature goddess. She may have arrived in Egypt via migrants from the Levant, and is well established, particularly in the northern delta region, during the Hyksos period. Though the New Kingdom pharaohs were hostile to Hyksos influence, Anat survives their departure and the reunification of Egypt under Amose I. She is adopted by Ramesses II (1304-1237BC), becoming his guardian in battle, and given a consort, RE-SHEPH. She was considered to be the mother of the gods, but is paradoxically also known as The Virgin. Her epithets reflect this duality: The Wanton, The Lady, The Destroyer, Strength of Life, Lady of the Mountain. The Egyptians knew her as Anat-her, 'agreeable Anat', or Herit-Anta, Terror of Anat. In the Hebrew colony around Elephantine in Upper Egypt she was known as Beth-El, House of God, and was worshipped in the temple of Yahweh on Elephantine Island. In her gentler role, she is the goddess of sexuality and is considered by the Egyptians as the most beautiful of all the gods. She protects the people, animals and crops in her role as fertility deity. The Egyptians saw her as the daughter of RA and the wife of SET, along with her sister ASTARTE. The Memphis tradition had her as the daughter of PTAH, and the New Kingdom Hebrews saw her as the wife of ANDJETY, who is associated with OSIRIS. She has some of the characteristics of NEITH, a delta goddess also associated with war and weaving. She had shrines in Tanis, the Hyksos capital, and Beit She'an in northern Israel. The Egyptians depict her as nude, with a plumed crown, standing on a lion and holding flowers, a sceptre, or an ankh, whereas the Syrians tended to depict her as a woman carrying a shield and an axe. The Phoenicians also depicted her as nude, with exaggerated sexual organs, bearing a bow and arrow or sometimes a spear or weaving spindle. She was also exported to Greece by merchants during the Hellenistic age to blend with ASTARTE, and shares some characteristics with the Anatolian CYBELE

A key figure in the Akkadian creation myth the Enuma Elish, Anshar is a sky-god ('sky-axle/pivot') ruling creation with his sister-wife KISHAR ('earth-axle/pivot'). Heaven in Sumerian is 'an' and Earth is 'ki', and both AN(U) and KI are the offspring of Anshar and Kishar.

He is the king of Libya, the giant son of POSEIDON and GE/GAIA. His wife is the goddess TINGE and he had a daughter, ALCEIS or BARCE.

The two came into conflict over who should rule, and after Eteocles succeeded in establishing himself in power, Polynices led the expedition of the Seven Against Thebes to unseat his brother. In the course of the siege, Eteocles and Polynices killed each other. The new king, Creon, gave Eteocles an honourable burial but ordered that the body of Polynices, whom he regarded as a traitor, remain where it had fallen. Antigone, believing divine law must take precedence over earthly decrees, buried her brother. Creon condemned her to be buried alive. She hanged herself in the tomb, and her grief-stricken lover, Haemon, Creon's son, killed himself.
B. Sister of Priam, King of Troy. She boasted to HERA about the beauty of her hair; Hera turned it into snakes. The gods took pity, and turned Antigone into a stork

ANU
Origin: Mesopotamia
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: ANUS, AN, DANU
Originally the Sumero-Akkadian fertility god AN, whose symbol, the bull, may link him to BAAL. There are early icons of a synonymous female deity, a celestial cow whose udders produce rain. He appears to have arisen in the city of Der, east of the Tigris River. His chthonic female counterpart is KI. Between them they founded the cosmos. In some texts he is depicted as the son of ANŠAR and KIŠAR. Between his first appearance in about 3500BC and 2000BC he developed into the supreme father of all gods, or King of the Gods, Father. He took a consort, ANTU, ANTUM or ANATUM, or, in some legends, ISHTAR. Worship centred on Erech (Uruk) in southern Mesopotamia. The name means ‘sky’, and Anu came to represent the northern zone of the ecliptic in Babylonian and Assyrian astral theology. His bull became the Bull of Heaven. He became involved in a triad of gods with ENLIL (his son the wind god, by NAMMU) and EA (ENKI), and by 2000BC had delegated his authority to Enlil. In Sanskrit, Anu means ‘subtle’. As father of the Hittite pantheon he is known as Anus and is deposed by his son ALALU(S), who is in turn usurped by KUMARBIS. All three are later banished to the underworld by the Hittite supreme deity TARHUN. His mantle is assumed by the Greeks' ZEUS and URANUS. For another (Celtic) Anu, see DANU

ANUBIS
Origin: Egypt
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: SEPA, ANPU, HERMANUBIS
God of the dead and guardian of the gateway to the underworld, he is one of Egypt's longest-serving deities, possibly arriving in the pre-dynastic period. He is popularly the son of RE and either NEPHTHYS or ISIS. He is worshipped from c. 2700BC to the end of the Egyptian period, c.AD400. He is represented as a man with a jackal’s head. His role (as 'Claimer of Hearts') is judge of the dead, whose souls he weighs in the great balance of life. His cult centre is the Memphis necropolis, though he is known and revered throughout Egypt. As The Embalmer, he watches over mummification procedures and ceremonies. He protects tombs and cemeteries. His position in the major Egyptian pantheon was usurped in later times by OSIRIS, who in turn was absorbed by the Graeco-Roman pantheon as HERMES. Curiously, he resurfaces here as HERMANUBIS

ANUNIT
Origin: Mesopotamia
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ANUNITU, ANUNITUM
Essentially a nature goddess, daughter or sister of the moon-god SIN and possibly derived from the early Sumerian KI, which would make her a mother or creator goddess, sky god AN(U)'s consort. A transition name for her would be ANTU. It would be tempting to redirect immediately to ISHTAR with whom most scholars agree she is synonymous. But she was worshipped in her own right into the late Babylonian period, principally at a shrine at Sippar, on the east bank of the Euphrates 60 miles north of Babylon, and was briefly the tutelary goddess of Akkad (Agade) before this role was taken over by Ishtar too. Like Ishtar, she is the Babylonian goddess of the moon and battle, also associated with the evening star, Venus, her symbol (again, like Ishtar) being the eight-pointed star. It has been suggested (by Blavatsky, H P?) that she is the morning star Venus, whereas Ishtar of Uruk/Erech was goddess of the evening-star Venus. She is a survivor, coming from East Semitic traditions and being worshipped in turn by Akkadians (In 3800BC Sargon initiated a sanctuary to her at Babylon – was this the one at Sippar?), Assyrians Chaldeans and Babylonians as the goddess of fertility, love, war and sex. She is synonymous with the Sumerians' INANNA and is the cognate for the Northwest Semitic/Aramean (Phoenician) goddess ASTARTE. She may also be cognate with the Greek ANAITIS
