He is usually depicted as a green-skinned man with a pharaonic beard, with legs partially wrapped in mummification bands, and wearing a tall crown with two ostrich feathers. He is usually holding a symbolic crook and flail. He is the god of the afterlife, the underworld and the dead – but since ancient Egyptians believed the dead to be the people who after their death and rebirth were the truly living ones, Osiris was often called 'king of the living', the 'lord of love', 'lord of silence', and 'he who is permanently benign and youthful'. Osiris was not only merciful judge of the dead prior to their entry into the afterlife, he was also lord of the powers that granted all life, including enabling crops and vegetation to grow, and causing the Nile to flood and fertilise and renew the Nile Valley soil. In this aspect he is linked to Orion and Sirius, constellations significant in identifying the start of a new year. Osiris is often described as the oldest son of the earth-god GEB and the sky-goddess NUT, and he is both husband and brother to ISIS. HORUS is his posthumously-begotten son. The worship of Osiris, principally at his cult centres at Abydos and Philae, continued into the Christian era, when it was suppressed and finally stamped out
