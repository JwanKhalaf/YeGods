RA
Origin: Egypt
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: RE
One of Egypt's most significant and ancient deities, he is a solar and creator god whose worship as such centred on Heliopolis, where he supplanted or combined attributes with the local sun-god ATUM. Many scholars now prefer the spelling 'Re'. As ATUM-RA he is depicted as the first being, born from the oceanic NUN, and the creator of SHU and TEFNUT, GEB and NUT, OSIRIS, SET, ISIS and NEPHTHYS – the pantheon and religious system known as the Ennead. In terms of creation, though, the followers of PTAH believed that Ptah created Ra and thus he, not Ra, was the supreme creator god, bringing into being the seasons, months, plants and animals and raising human life either through his tears and sweat, or by speaking their secret names. Atum as an aspect of Ra is the ram-headed deity of the evening sun, though this role is also shared with another of Ra's manifestations, KHNUM, also a ram-headed god. Ra himself is identified with the midday sun; Ra's manifestation as KHEPRI, the scarab beetle who rolls up the sun from the underworld, is his morning sun manifestation. Ra merges with Osiris, god of the dead, after sunset and until dawn: Egyptians believed Ra's sun-chariot travelled through the underworld, land of the dead, during the hours of darkness. The boatman aspect of Ra is KHEPERA. Humanity rebelled against Ra at one stage, and he sent the goddess SEKHMET in the form of a raging lion – the fiery Eye of Ra - into their midst to wreak vengeance. By the fifth dynasty (2494-2345BC) Ra's worship had extended throughout Egypt. In later dynasties, RA merged gradually with HORUS as RE-HORAKHTY, ('Ra (who is) Horus of the Two Horizons'). Then when the New Kingdom emerged (1550-1069BC) and the god AMUN rose to prominence, he was fused with him to become AMUN-RA. Ra suffered another brief setback during the reign of Akhenaten (1353-1336?BC) when he was suppressed in favour of another solar deity, the ATEN. After Akhenaten's death Ra was restored to favour and was worshipped actively into the early Christian era. In iconography Ra is depicted in many ways, the most common being as a hawk-headed man with a serpent-entwined solar disk above his head. As Khepri he is a man with a beetle's head. In his role as underworld traveller he is a man with the head of a ram. He is also depicted as being a full-bodied ram, a beetle, a phoenix, a heron, a serpent,  a cat or a lion. His Heliopolis manifestation was as a bull, and bulls were sacrificed to him – and entombed -  at a site north of the city

RAIDEN
Origin:  Japanese: Shintoism
Sex: M	
Category: Deity
Aliases: RAIJIN, YAKUSA NO IKAZUCHI NO KAMI, KAMINARI-SAMA, RAIDEN-SAMA, NARUKAMI		
The name means 'Thunder god', rai in Japanese meaning thunder, and shin meaning god; his Westernised version, Raiden, is literally 'thunder lightning'. He was created by the divine pair  IZANAMI and IZANAGI after the creation of Japan. He is the storm god, a demonic figure beating drums to create thunder. He appears in mythology under several names or titles: YAKUSA NO IKAZUCHI NO KAMI ('Eight Thunder Spirit') KAMINARI-SAMA ('Thunder Master') RAIDEN-SAMA (Thunder-lightning Master') and NARUKAMI ('Thunder/rolling Spirit'). The first of these titles refers to the legend in which eight lightning gods were given the the task by the BUDDHA of defending the DHARMA, a religious syncretism (Shinto plus Buddhism) that is not unusual in Japan. The iconography of the Raijin and FUUJIN gods has been heavily influenced by Buddhist art, itself influenced by Greek and Indian art. In Western culture Raiden is depicted as a tall monk wearing a large straw rain-hat, an image popularised by various computer games

The concept of a Rainbow Serpent, common across virtually all Aboriginal Australian traditions and one of the oldest continuous religious beliefs in the world, has been tainted by Western anthropologists' assumptions – that this is one entity in many forms, appearing in many legends; and that the serpent is  'chief deity' of the Aborigines, in the way that Zeus, Odin or Jupiter might be to Western thought. It's true the Rainbow Serpent is often a creator-deity, though it can be male, female, hermaphrodite or without any sexual attributes. It is a motif for art, a 'dreamtime' entity, and is inevitably linked with the appearance of water and its seasonal life-giving qualities, though the Rainbow Serpent can be a destroyer, in the way that storms and floods can destroy.  It is named for the obvious identification between the shape of a rainbow and the shape of a snake.  When the rainbow is seen in the sky, it is said to be the Rainbow Serpent moving from one waterhole to another, and the divine concept explained why some waterholes never dry up when drought strikes. As a creator entity, the snake has ploughed the landscape into its present shape, emerging from the earth to create ridges and troughs. The serpent's many names (with the tribal groups in brackets) include BORLUNG (the Miali); DHAKKAN or TAKKAN (the Kuli); KAJURA (the Ingarda); GOORIALLA (the Lardil); KUNMANGGUR (the Murinbata); NGALYOD (the Gunwinggu); NUMEREJI (the Kakadu); TAIPAN (the Wikmunkan); TULLOUN (the Mitakoodi); WAGYL (the Noongar); WANAMANGURA (the Talainji) and WITIJ (the Yolngu)

Aliases: RAM, RAMA-CHANDRA
Generally in Indian and Nepalese Hinduism, Rama is seventh of the 10 dasavatars (= ‘descents’, avatars or incarnations) of VISHNU, and hero of the Ramayana epic. His birthplace was Ahodhya, where he is worshipped as RAMA LALLA. He is regarded in Vedic tradition as the supreme god-king, the embodiment of goodness come down to earth, and some sects consider him to be the supreme deity. He is usually depicted as blue-skinned and handsome, and carrying a golden bow, arrows and a quiver. He is the noble hero who fights the evil of the world – typified by the wicked ten-headed demon emperor of Lanka, RAVANA - armed only with his virtue. In the Ramayana, he is ousted from his throne and separated from his wife SITA, who is kidnapped by Ravana. He is taken to Sri Lanka, where he is befriended by the monkey god HANUMAN, who with his monkey army builds a bridge over which Rama is able to return to India. The relationship between Rama and Sita is regarded by Hindus as the perfect archetype of a loving marriage. Rama’s faithful younger brother is LAKSHMANA or LAKSHMAN. His children with SITA are the twins KUSHA and LAVA

RANGI

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: RANGINUI
Sky deity, partner to PAPATŪĀNUKU, the earth mother, giver of birth to all things. The two, sometimes abbreviated to Rangi and Papa, lie in legend locked in a tight embrace. Their many male children are forced to live in the cramped darkness between them. TŪMATUENGA, the fiercest of these children and god of the ocean and war, thinks the best way to free themselves is to kill their parents, but his brother TĀNE, god of forests, disagrees. Each deity – RONGO, god of agriculture, TAWHIRI-MA-TEA, god of winds and hurricanes, WHIRO, the evil one, who became lord of the dark areas of life, TANGAROA and HAUMIA-TIKETIKE - tries to push their parents apart, but Tāne finally manages it by lying on his back and pushing with his strong legs. Mists and rain are symbolic of their sorrow at parting. Ranginui is essentially the same deity as the Indonesian UPU, the Ceramese LANGI, the Ambonese LANITO, and some researchers link him to the Chinese TIEN, the Mongolese TENGRI, the Vedic DYAUS, the Greeks' ZEUS and so on. These deities cannot yet be linked linguistically or demographically

RAVEN
Origin: North America: the Haida people of the Pacific north-west coast
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: XHUUYA, NANKIL'SLAS, WEGYET
A creator and trickster-deity who appears in many forms, in dozens of stories, across North America. The myths associated with him depict him as a benevolent and well-meaning though sometimes thoughtless and troublesome deity, shaping the world for human beings and defending them against enemies. A clever innocent, he is often the victim of COYOTE, also a prankster god. His brother is LOGOBOLA. He is the disgraced servant of the supreme creator and sky-god of the Haida, SHA-LANA. He was cast out of the kingdom of heaven and went on to create the world out of the primordial ocean or after a cleansing flood. He created human beings by carving men out of wood and moulding women from clay – or discovered them hiding in a clam-shell after the flood and fed them on berries and salmon.  In one set of stories he is the father of an unruly child, or  the child itself. To pacify it, the child is given a box full of sparks which he throws through the smoke-hole to create the stars; or a box with the moon, which he again throws into the skies. A final box of light is thrown by the child/raven into the skies, and becomes the sun. The Algonquian people say Raven was originally white and was the only being to know the whereabouts of the deity CHIBIABOS, who had been captured by 'underwater panthers'.  MANABAZHO, the missing god's brother, held Raven over a fire to make him reveal where Chibiabos was, and this permanently blackened Raven's feathers. The Tlingit people, also of the Pacific north-west coast, depict Raven as the god of light, created at the same time as HERON by the deity NASCAKIYETL. Another legend has him the son of KITKAOSITIYIKA. He stole boxes of stars, planets and the sun from Nascakiyetl and scattered them. He created the winds and the tribes. He stole water from PETREL to irrigate the barren land and stole fire from the heavens to give to his people. He introduced the arts of fishing and hunting and propped the earth up with the leg of a beaver

Other names include 'Red Man' and he is depicted with his entire body painted red. Red Horn is one of five sons of EARTHMAKER, whom the Creator-deity made with his own hands and sent to earth to rescue humanity. To do so he battled with giants and water spirits. As 'One Horn' or 'Without Horns' he and his sons are chiefs of hunting spirits. In this instance, Red Horn is identified with the arrow

He bore the head of a gazelle on his forehead and in joint Phoenician and Hittite inscriptions he is referred to as ‘deer god’ and ‘gazelle god’. Resheph was identified or confused with the Babylonian death god NERGAL and perhaps associated like  Nergal with the planet Mars.  In Phoenician inscriptions he is called rshp gn ‘Resheph of the Garden’ and `l chotz ‘lord of the arrow’.  Resheph become popular in Egypt during the 18th dynasty (1540-1307BC) and with another Chaldean god, QETESH (goddess of sexual acts), he was taken to be the father of MIN (god of fertility). The name appears as a word in classical Hebrew with the alternate meanings ‘flame’ and ‘plague’.

Rhea concealed ZEUS from him in a cave on Crete, giving Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead. In the Roman pantheon she surfaces as R SILVIA, the mother of ROMULUS and REMUS by MARS (or HERCULES), and is a wife of SATURNUS. QUIRINUS, in some stories, is the son of MARS by Rhea Silvia

Aliases: ROBIGUS
Protective deities of crops against blight, Robigo female, Robigus male. They are also deities of ecstatic prophecy resulting from the use of ergot infected rye and similar infections of other grains. Robigus's sacred day is April 25, the Robigalia, where the flamen Quirinalis made offerings of dog and sheep to him. In the Fasti Ovid used a feminine form of Robigo as the deity worshipped at Robigalia.  Columella and Augustine agreed with Ovid, while Varro (L.L. 6.16) and  Verius Flaccus (CIL 1:236, 316) use the male form Robigus. Ovid says the sacrifice made to Robigo on the Robigalia was a dog; Columella has the sacrum canarium as a suckling puppy (Rustica 10. 343-3). But this latter sacrifice was made at the Porta Catularia when the Dog Star Sirius was rising, which Ovid says in Fasti 4. 904. However the rising of Sirius would have been setting at this time of year, rising only in early August. Pliny mentions instead an augurium canarium being made in late spring before the ears of grain emerged from their husks (N.H. 18. 14). A dog was also sacrificed at the Lupercalia, along with goats, and a feast was then held
