Though Inyan himself is now retired, his will is exercised by the four Wak-Inyan, his messengers and companions, the Mysterious Flyers or Thunderbirds, who appear in the mythologies of a number of Indian nations. Among the Lakota, four types are recognised: black, blue, red, and yellow. They are huge creatures of thunder and lightning, hiding in the clouds. The Wak-Inyan brought stone from Inyan with which the earth is built; the first rains; and their lightning brought the first light to earth.

Such objects, together with the bag they are within, are thought to take on an independent existence in their own right, and thus must be carefully dealt with. The term can be applied to any of a wide variety of foci of mystery and power; one such application was to people of European descent when the Lakota first came in contact with them

WEPWAWET
Origin: Egypt
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: OPHIOS, UPUAUT
Wepwawet, a son of ISIS, is one of several Egyptian deities to take canine form. Though he was originally thought to have been vulpine, current thought is that he is more likely associated with the jackal, like ANUBIS. And like Anubis, Wepwawet was also a funerary deity, one of the earliest of the gods worshipped at Abydos. Early on, Wepwawet’s worship paralleled that of KHENTE AMENTIU, but when OSIRIS absorbed that god’s attributes, Anubis filled his funerary role. However, with the rise of the solar cult, particularly during the 12th dynasty, Osiris was limited to the underworld and the local god and lord of the cemetery at Abydos was filled by Wepwawet, who gained the titles ‘Lord of Abydos’ and ‘Lord of the Necropolis’. Wepwawet’ cult centres also included Quban, el-Hargarsa, Memphis, Sais and particularly the thirteenth ancient nome of Upper Egypt. This is the location of modern Asyut, which the Greeks called Lycopolis. This may be the origin of the misinterpretation of Wepwawet as a wolf, for Lycopolis can be interpreted as the ‘Town of the Wolf’. Wepwawet’s name means ‘the opener of the ways (or Roads)’, possibly denoting Wepwawet’s function as leading the deceased through the underworld as a protector, but also earlier, when he was a warlike deity, he may have been the one who ‘opened the way’ for the Egyptian army. Wepwawet was also thought of as the messenger and champion of royalty. Like SHU, he was also referred to as the ‘one who has separated the sky from the earth.’ Wepwawet’s standard was carried preceding the king from the palace or temple during processions, and during the New Kingdom, Wepwawet’s standard even preceded that of Osiris. In fact, Wepwawet’s standard symbolised Upper Egypt in royal processions, while Lower Egypt’s counterpart was the APIS bull of Memphis. However, one inscription provides that he was born in the sanctuary of the goddess WADJET at Buto in the Nile Delta, though this was most likely politically inspired, considering that all evidence points to his Upper Egyptian origins

Woyengi comes to us from a creation myth of the Ijaw people of Nigeria. Though it was first recorded at around AD1700, it probably dates to around 2700BC. The myth says that among nothingness something sparked and created time. In that second, Heaven and Earth were formed and Woyengi was sent to Earth from a lightning storm. All Woyengi found on the empty Earth was a chair, a table and a flat stone called the Stone of Creation. Not knowing what else to do, Woyengi scooped up handfuls of mud and sat in the chair, propping her feet up on the stone. With the mud, she moulded many dolls, sat them on the stone and then blew her breath across their face. She asked them if they wanted to be male or female, and gave them the correct reproductive organs. After this was done, Woyengi lined the dolls up on the table and asked them what kind of work they’d like to do. When they’d chosen, Woyengi sat them down and pointed to two streams. “Now you must follow the right stream and it will carry you to where you must be in the world,” she said. The stream filled with rocks and rapids belonged to the dolls that had chosen a life of importance or power. Those that had chosen and easy life were sent down a calm, clear stream with dangerous quicksand in the shallows. The streams carried the dolls into the world and into the lives they had chosen
