Aliases: MEBEGHE
Mebege is essentially a pre-creator; before time, only he and the cosmic spider DIABOBA existed in the space between sky and water. The spider suggested he create living beings so, taking a hair from his armpit, a pebble from the bottom of the water, and a piece of his own brain, he formed an egg which he gave to Diaboba. He told the spider to dip the egg in the water. When the egg cracked, ZAME YE MEBEGE (God), NYINGWAN MEBEGE (Sister of God) and NLONA MEBEGE (brother of God and creator of evil) emerged. Mebege and Diaboba left creation to Zame, who did the trick with the armpit hair and brain to create another egg, which cracked to release termite and worms. Their droppings produced soil, which hardened into solid land. After creating a raffia tree, Zame decided to create Man

She is turned into a guineafowl by Artemis on the death of her brother, MELEAGER. D: An AMAZON (see Appendix), sister of HIPPOLYTE and ANTIOPE, and daughter of ARES.

The son of BASTET, Mihos is a lion-god, a deity of war and protector of the horizon (ie, borders) who first came to prominence in the New Kingdom. In his capacity as protector he guards the pharaoh in battle, but also helps RA fight against the evil serpent APEP in the sun (-god)’s journey through the night/underworld. He is worshipped at Leontopolis (modern Tell el-Muqdam) in Nome 11 of Lower Egypt in the Eastern Delta. Osorkon III (Dynasty XXII) erected a temple to him at Bubastis, the town sacred to the god’s mother. By Greek times he was seen as a god of storms and winds. He also had links to perfumes and oils. In the new Kingdom he is usually depicted as a lion-headed man carrying a knife or a sword, and sometimes wears the atef crown or the solar disk and uraeus on his head. His various titles include ‘Wielder of the Knife’, ‘The Scarlet Lord’ ‘Helper of the Wise Ones’, ‘Lord of Slaughter’, ‘Manifester of Will’, ‘The Initiator’, and ‘Avenger of Wrongs’. Mihos repels evil, protects initiates, and stands guard during magical rites. He is a god of sight, sun god of the Nile Delta, and god of midsummer, who was invoked to bring forth the souls of men, gods, and underworld spirits for divination or to discover truth. He was thought to be one of Osiris’s executioners. Yet he was also called on to protect the innocent. Thothmose III describes him as being the son of SEKHMET, but elsewhere he is named as son of BAST(ET) and PTAH or even RA. Mihos may also be connected to the lion-headed deities SHESMU and NEFERTEM. He was also connected with the war-god ONURIS as well as with the sky god SHU. There are suggestions that he might have been an assimilation of the Nubian lion-god APEDEMAK

Min first emerges as ‘Chief of Heaven’ a sky god whose symbol is the thunderbolt. In this role he becomes a rain god, and thus a fertility deity, especially in the growing of grain, though lettuce, thought by the Egyptians to be an aphrodisiac, became his sacred plant. A further role is as protector of travellers in the Eastern Sahara, specifically those who moved by caravanserai from his cult centre at Koptos to the Red Sea. A second cult centre was at Akhmim. As the Lord of Foreign Lands he was the protector of nomads and hunters. He is pictured in pharaonic garb, bearded, with feathered crown and brandishing a whip, flail or thunderbolt. His fertility role led him to be adopted as a deity of male sexuality, in which role he is endowed with a large erect penis. Thus he becomes identified by the Greeks as the equivalent of PAN, and by the Romans as PRIAPUS. He is absorbed into the Egyptian pantheon by becoming a son of RA and SHU. By the time of the New Kingdom he is depicted as a white bull, and in the Middle Kingdom he has become linked with the falcon god HAROERIS (HORUS the Elder). A minor role was a lunar god: one text describes him as ‘Protector of the Moon’. His name and powers are invoked at planting and harvest times, but his most popular worship was orgiastic

MITHRAS
Origin: Persia
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: MITRA, MEITROS, MIHR, MEHR, MEHER, DADOPHOROI
A remarkable god, often pictured as a man slaying a bull, who is first recorded 4,000 years ago in Persia, but whose worship crossed all of Europe and much of Asia, his principal exponents being the trade routes to the East and the spread of the Roman Empire. His names include MITRA, MEITROS, MIHR, MEHR and MEHER, and DADOPHOROI. His worship was first assimilated into the religious beliefs of the Babylonians, though the faith swiftly transcended national boundaries and found its way into India and China, as far south as North Africa and as far north as Scotland. The Romans encountered the mystery cult of Mithraism in Asia Minor as part of Persian Zoroastrianism and his worship quickly became accepted because the faith appealed to the Roman military. Temples were constructed throughout the Empire, and Mithras became the god of the Roman emperors for 300 years. Mithras was the protector god of tribal society prior to Zoroaster’s reform of Persian polytheism during 655-628BC and was assimilated into Zoroastrianism as a the most prominent of the Yazata, or good spirits operating under the SPENTA MAINYU. These reforms retained the hundreds of Persian deities in a complex hierarchy of ‘Immortals’ and ‘Adored Ones’, of which Mithras became the ‘Judger of Souls’, directed to protect the righteous from the demonic forces of AHRIMAN, guiding their souls to Paradise. He was omniscient, undeceivable, infallible and eternally watchful. He guaranteed the authority of contracts and saw to it that promises were kept. According to Persian traditions, the god Mithras was actually incarnated into the human form of the Saviour expected by Zarathustra. Mithras was born of ANAHITA, an immaculate virgin mother once worshipped as a fertility goddess before the hierarchical reformation. Anahita was said to have conceived the Saviour from the seed of Zarathustra preserved in the waters of Lake Hamun in the Persian province of Sistan. Mithra’s ascension to heaven was said to have occurred in 208 BC, 64 years after his birth. Parthian coins and documents bear a double date with this 64 year interval. Mithras was ‘The Great King’ highly revered by the nobility and monarchs, who looked upon him as their special protector. Persian Mithraism was more a collection of traditions and rites than a body of doctrines. However, once the Babylonians took the Mithraic rituals and mythology from the Persians, they thoroughly refined its theology. The Babylonian clergy assimilated AHURA-MAZDA to the god BAAL, Anahita to the goddess ISHTAR, and Mithras to SHAMASH, their god of justice, victory and protection (and the sun god from whom King Hammurabi received his code of laws in the 18th century BC). As a result of the solar and astronomical associations of the Babylonians, Mithras later was referred to by Roman worshippers as ‘SOL INVICTUS’, or the invincible sun. The sun itself was considered to be ‘the eye of Mithras’. The Persian crown, from which all present day crowns are derived, was designed to represent the golden sun-disc sacred to Mithras. As a deity connected with the sun and its life-giving powers, Mithras was known as ‘The Lord of the Wide Pastures’ who was believed to cause the plants to spring forth from the ground. In the time of Cyrus and Darius the Great, the rulers of Persia received the first fruits of the fall harvest at the festival of Mehragan. At this time they wore their most brilliant clothing and drank wine. In the Persian calendar, the seventh month and the sixteenth day of each month were also dedicated to Mithras. According to Persian mythology, Mithras was born of a virgin given the title ‘Mother of God’. The God remained celibate throughout his life, and valued self-control, renunciation and resistance to sensuality among his worshippers. Mithras represented a system of ethics in which brotherhood was encouraged in order to unify against the forces of evil. The Persians called Mithras ‘The Mediator’ since he was believed to stand between the light of Ahura-Mazda and the darkness of AHRIMAN. He was said to have 1,000 eyes, expressing the conviction that no man could conceal his wrongdoing from the god. Mithras was known as the God of Truth, and Lord of Heavenly Light. He was worshipped as guardian of arms, and patron of soldiers and armies. The handshake was developed by those who worshipped him as a token of friendship and as a gesture to show that you were unarmed. When Mithras later became the Roman god of contracts, the handshake gesture was imported throughout the Mediterranean and Europe by Roman soldiers. In Armenian tradition, Mithras was believed to shut himself up in a cave from which he emerged once a year, born anew. The Persians introduced initiates to the mysteries in natural caves, according to Porphyry, the third century neoplatonic philosopher. These cave temples were created in the image of the World Cave that Mithras had created, according to the Persian creation myth. Mithra is an Indo-Iranian sun god. In Hinduism he is praised as the binomial MITRA-VARUNA. A hymn is also dedicated to him alone in Rig Veda. He is the Lord of Heavenly light, protector of truth, and is invoked when a contract or oath is taken. The Babylonians also incorporated their belief in destiny into the Mithraic worship of ZURVAN, the Persian god of infinite time and father of the gods Ahura-Mazda and Ahriman. They superimposed astrology, the use of the zodiac, and the deification of the four seasons onto the Persian rites of Mithraism. Mithra is also seen in Chinese mythology, where he is known as The Friend. Mithra is represented as a military general in Chinese statues, and is considered to be the friend of man in this life and his protector against evil in the next
