1. Son of TELEMON, king of Salamis.  A mighty warrior, called the ‘bulwark of the Achaeans’ by Homer, he led the forces of Salamis to Troy.  He was unshakable in battle but somewhat slow of speech. Angered because he was not awarded the armour of the dead ACHILLES, Ajax resolved to kill the Greek leaders  AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS. To prevent this, the goddess ATHENA struck him with madness. In his delirium, Ajax committed suicide by falling on his sword
2. Son of Oileus of Locris, and sometimes known as Ajax the Lesser. Like his namesake, he fought in the Trojan War. After the fall of Troy, he violated the temple of ATHENA by dragging the prophet CASSANDRA from the altar of the goddess. Athena appealed to the sea god POSEIDON to avenge the sacrilege. When the Greeks sailed for home, Poseidon sent a great tempest. Ajax was shipwrecked, but managed to swim to shore. Clinging to a jagged rock, he boasted that he was a man whom the sea could not drown. Angered by his words, Poseidon split the rock with his trident, and Ajax was swept away by the waves

AKER
Origin: Egypt
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: AKAR (pl AKERU or AKHERUI)
One of the earliest Egyptian gods, worshipped in the Old Kingdom (about 2700BC onward), possibly before other earth gods such as GEB. He is a god of the horizon, of past and future, yesterday and today. He is sufficiently powerful for the Pyramid Texts to say that the Akeru or Akherui (plurals of Aker) will not seize the Pharoah. He represents the horizon and thus the borders between each day, and is often depicted as a narrow strip of land with lion heads facing opposite directions (sunrise, sunset). As time went on, these lion heads became full lion figures and were named: SEF, for yesterday, and DUAU, for today. Aker then became called RUTI (Egyptian for ‘two lions’). Between them would appear the sun’s disc between two mountains, the hieroglyph for the horizon. Aker also guarded the entrance to the underworld, opening them for the sun to pass through during the night, and thus his symbols came to be used at the entrance to tombs and palaces. Worship of Aker persisted into Graeco-Roman times. It’s interesting to note how many substantial homes in England position lions either side of their gateway, presumably ignorant of the extreme antiquity of the trend. The Akeru are Aker's emissaries, seizing and keeping the souls of the deceased

AL KUTBAY

Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: AKTAB-KUTBAY
Sometimes also known as AKTAB-KUTBAY, under which name he is linked with Egypt’s god THOT,  Al Kutbay was the god of learning, commerce, writing, and divination. The name comes from the Arabic ktb which means ‘to write.’ He first came to the attention of historians when a carving of him and AL‘UZZA were found just east of Petra in 1959. Since then, inscriptions, images and graffiti have been identified across Arabia and into Egypt, many at springs, oases and route crossings. His worship appears to have been brought to Egypt by caravan merchants, where two Nabataean temples have been excavated. According to the Annals of Sennacherib (8th century BC), the god RULDAIU (RUDA) was worshipped by the Arabs. He can be identified with ORTALT of Herodotus (5th century BC) and with Aktab-Kutbay of the Lihyanites and Nabataeans. With Hellenisation, Al-Kutbay began to be associated with the Greek Hermes and Roman Mercury. Al Kutbay is also linked with the Assyrian god NABU, ARSO or ARSU of Palmyra, and the Safaitic RUDA

ALLAH
Origin: Arabic (originally Nabataean):  Islam
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: AL-ASMA', AL-HUSNA, AL-ILAH, AL-RAHMAN, AL-RAHMI		
The supreme Creator, judge and rewarder, the almighty and merciful, the omnipotent pivot of Islam. The name itself is thought to be a contraction of al-ilah (‘the God’) and has been the standard Semitic word for God since at least 300BC, the root of which is 'Il'. Some scholars have linked ALLA, a deity of 'violence and revolution' in 1700BC Babylon, to present-day Allah, though this is controversial. Allah is said to have 100 names, 99 of which are known; the last one is a universal secret. The most popular names/descriptives are AL-RAHMAN  and AL-RAHMI, meaning The Merciful and The Mercy-giver respectively, though others include ‘the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the Giver of Peace, the Keeper of Faith, the Guardian, the Mighty One, the All-powerful, the Most High’ . . . ‘the Creator, the Originator, the Modeller . . .the Mighty, the Wise One’ . . .’the Compassionate, the Forgiver, the Forgiving, the Clement, the Generous, the Affectionate, the Kind . . .’ The etymological root El (ilah) is the same as that in early Judaism. BEL, BAAL, BELSHAMIN etc are all related. Those who have controversially suggested that Allah is the Islamic version of the pre-Islamic HUBAL have gone on to give the pre-Islamic Allah three daughters, AL-‘UZZA, AL-LAT and MANAT/MANAWAT. The present-day concept of Allah is embodied in the Koran and interpretations and expansions of same. He is (by Islamic law) unrepresented in art

Aliases: ALLAT, ALLATU, AL-LATU, ALILAT, ALLĀT, AL-LĀT, ALLATU, ALLATUM,  ELLAT, ELAT
The most ancient Mesopotamian sources depict al-Lat as a goddess of the underworld, the equivalent of  EREŠKIGAL, later adopted into the Indo-Iranian pantheon. As ELLAT or ELAT in Canaanite religion she is the consort of EL or IL(AH) and equates most probably with ARSAY. She is recognised by the Carthaginians as ALLATU. Al-Lāt as a title can be applied also to ASHERAH AND ATHIRAT. A thousand years later, in the pre-Islamic world, she is transformed into the goddess of spring and fertility, sometimes depicted as one of the three daughters of HUBAL and thus, by some, as the daughter (or wife) of ALLAH, may have been first worshipped in the kingdom of Nabataea, but inscriptions mentioning her have been found further south in Saudi Arabia and as far north as Syria. Etymology would suggest she is a feminine form of ALLAH. Her worship seems to have blended seamlessly across the early Semitic world and with early Islamic tradition. Images of her and her sister AL ‘UZZA were found at Mecca and some historians say Mohammed and later Islamic leaders at least tolerated her presence. Nevertheless Mohammed had her shrine in Ta'if demolished. Her name means ‘The Goddess’.  She was a protectress of certain localities whose name would be mentioned in conjunction with hers. At Palmyra she was equated with ASTARTE and, in Greek times, with ATHENA and thus with the Roman goddess MINERVA, sometimes with APHRODITE or URANIA/VENUS CAELESTIS

ALPAN
Origin: Etruscan (Roman)
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: ALPANU
Alpan, like AKHUVITR, is a goddess about whom not much is known. She is probably one of the LASAS, destiny-goddesses with underworld connections. Like many other Etruscan goddesses, she is often shown bearing great wings. Her name means ‘gift’ or ‘offering’, with willingness implied; perhaps on this basis, and the fact that she is usually portrayed naked, she is sometimes called a love-goddess. Other sources describe her as a goddess of springtime, and in some depictions she is shown holding bouquets of flowers, jewels or leaves. Like Venus, Alpan may have been both a love-goddess and spring-goddess. She seems to have survived into 19th century Tuscany as the fairy Alpena, who was also called La Bellaria, a sprite of the air and light who is the goddess of flowers, spring and beauty, associated with the sky, clouds, and the rainbow. She is associated with APHRODITE. But see also ARKATE

The sleepers became stars guided by Al Qaum through the heavenly realms, and travellers were guided by these stars through the desert at night

AL-‘UZZA
Origin: Arabic: Nabataean	
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: 	AL-'UZZAH	
Al-‘Uzza is the goddess of power, and devotion both human and religious, and as such may be regarded as the superior of the Nabataeans’ three chief goddesses of the pantheon, Al-‘Uzza, AL-LĀT and MANAT/MANAWAT. Under Hellenisation, Al-‘Uzza was later identified with Aphrodite, Urania/Venus Caelestis, and also linked to the Egyptian goddess Isis. Representations of Al-‘Uzza (/Aphrodite) are carved on the Treasury at Petra. She is also mentioned as a deity of the city, and her cult continued at Mecca until the coming of Islam. She and her sisters were considered to be Allah’s daughters. The supreme female goddess was also associated with vegetation and grain. Her symbols also included leaves, fruits, cornucopiae, and the usual cereal grain stalks. She is depicted as Mistress of the Earth, Heaven and the Underworld, aspects she may have gained as the Nabataeans traded with Egypt and were influenced by the cult of Isis, whose attributed and powers Al-‘Uzza seems to have absorbed. She is sometimes depicted in feline form or, on a ring seal found in Petra, nude/crowned, riding on a dolphin, as Mistress of the Sea. This clearly identifies her as a goddess of water, the sea and travellers thereon – odd, perhaps, for a desert deity, until one realises that the Nabataeans also plied the Arabian Gulf for trade. She is also the goddess of 'living' water ie springs (vital to survival in desert Petra), and thus of fertility in general. The Winged Lions Temple in Petra is probably dedicated to Al ‘Uzza rather than, as was originally thought, ATARGATIS.  Some authorities believe Al-‘Uzzah developed from Al-Lat, whose name simply means ‘the goddess’. See also ATARGATIS

She is the sun goddess, a goddess of power and light, growth and fertility, from which the emperors trace their descent and divinity. She is an important Shinto deity, born from the left eye of her father IZANAGI.  Her brother is the storm-god SUSANO-WO, with whom she falls out after Susano-wo behaves badly. She returns to a cave, and so doing plunges the world into darkness. The gods fail to persuade her to leave the cave; so a goddess, AMA-NO-UZUME, leaps onto a upturned canoe with a bunch of bamboo leaves and performs an obscene dance, exposing her breasts and lowering her clothes down to her pubic area. This makes the gods laugh, and Amaterasu emerges from her cave to see what the fuss is about. Her worship centred at the grand Shrine of Ise, the foremost Shinto shrine in Japan. She is manifested there in a mirror. Her principal sanctuary is at Ise Naiku. Some religionists identify her with the Buddhist VAIROCANA

The name means Hidden One. She is an Egyptian mother- and/or snake-headed fertility-goddess, with her husband/consort AMUN a member of the eight-strong Hermopolitan Ogdoad, four husband-and-wife couples. Aspects of Amaunet eventually merged with those of the goddess NEITH. She was replaced later, at Thebes, by MUT. She was regarded as a tutelary deity of the Egyptian pharaohs, and had a prominent part in the pharaoh’s accession ceremonies. Her shadow, among the primeval gods, is a symbol of protection. She was worshipped at Karnak temple at least from the reign of Sesostris I (Dynasty XII). A statue datable to Tutankhamun's reign which was set up in the Record Hall of Tuthmosis III at Karnak shows the goddess in human form wearing the Red Crown of the Delta. Reliefs at Karnak clearly mark her as prominent in rituals closely associated with the monarch's accession and jubilee festival. For instance, in the monument of Tuthmosis III, known as the Akh-menu, Amaunet and MIN lead a row of deities to watch the king and sacred bull in the jubilee celebration. Much later in the Greek domination of Egypt she is carved on the exterior wall of the sanctuary suckling the pharaoh Philip Arrhidaeus who is playing the role of the divine child immediately following the scene depicting his enthronement. She retains her own identity well into the Ptolemaic period, until her merger with NEITH

With his wife AMAUNET he is one of the Ogdoad, or eight primordial gods (four husband-and-wife couples) of Egyptian religion. His cult spread, reaching Thebes some time before 1991BCE, when he became the patron of the pharaohs. Simultaneously he was identified with the sun-god RE of Heliopolis and as Amon-Re/Ra became the national god, ‘King of the Gods’, the primordial creator deity. He enjoyed a lengthy sovereignty, being worshipped at Karnak as its Lord, the supreme deity, but by the time of the sack of Thebes c. 663BC he had been reduced once again to a local deity. He was represented in human form, often with a ram’s head. He was part of the ‘Theban triad’ which included his wife MUT and adopted son KHONS/KHONSU/ KHENSU.
