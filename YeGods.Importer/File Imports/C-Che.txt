CABIERI
Origin: Greek
Sex: M, F
Category: Deity
Aliases: CABIRI, AXIERUS, AXIOCERSA, AXIOCERSUS, CADMILUS
Generic term for a group of deities, probably Phrygian, who were worshipped over much of Asia Minor, Macedonia and in central and northern Greece. They promoted fertility and protected sailors. In classical times there seem to have been two male deities, AXIOCERSUS and CADMILUS, of whom the former was the more powerful. Cadmilus is depicted in some instances as Axiocersus’s son and/or attendant. There were two female deities, AXIERUS and AXIOCERSA, and the Greeks identified these with various deities from their own pantheon, and identified their mother as ELEKTRA. The Cabieri cult worshipped the power of fertility, and reached its zenith after the death of Alexander the Great in 323BC. The Cabieri are often identified with the GREAT GODS OF SAMOTHRACE

In myth, the son of PHOENIX or AGENOR (king of the Phoenicians) and brother of EUROPA. Europa was carried off by ZEUS and Cadmus was sent to find her. Unsuccessful, the Delphic oracle suggested he follow a cow, and to found a city where the cow lay down. He did: it did so: and he founded the city of Thebes in Beoetia (‘Cow Land’). Later, Cadmus sowed the teeth of a dragon he had killed. From them sprang a race of warriors called Sparti (‘the Sown’). Cadmus married HARMONIA, daughter of ARES and APHRODITE. They had a son, POLYDORUS, and four daughters, INO, AUTONOË, AGAVE and SEMELE. Cadmus and Harmonia retired to Illyria, were changed into black serpents and sent to the Isles of the Blessed by ZEUS.

Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: BEIRA, CARLIN, CAILLECH BEINE BRIC, CRONE OF BEARE, THE VEILED ONE
The Cailleach Bheur (Ireland) or Carlin (Scotland) is a blue-faced hag associated with winter. Modern folklorist David Andrew Mackenzie named her BEIRA and described her as being a one-eyed giantess with white hair, blue skin and rust-coloured teeth. According to Mackenzie, she built the mountains of Scotland with her magic hammer, dropping them as stones from her apron. Her mountain 'throne' is Ben Nevis. She is reborn on every All Hallows Eve (October 31/November 1, Samhain) and brings the winter and the winter snows. Some areas see her as a destructive witch or goddess of evil magic, others as the All-Mother in her final manifestation, that of a death-dealing crone. She is probably the inspiration for the witch-like BLACK ANNIS. In her original, pre-Celtic form she appears to have been the goddess of the earth and sky, the moon and sun, the seasons and the weather. She carries a magical staff which freezes the ground with every tap. She is also guardian to animals throughout the winter, and returns to the earth when the goddess BRIGID turns her to stone on Beltane Eve, April 30. As the queen of winter her reign ends annually on the longest day of the year. On this day she visits the Well of Youth and drinks its magic water, thereby growing younger every day. In other traditions she changes into a young maiden, suggesting the changing phases of an earth goddess. Her sacred trees are the holly and the gorse bush, under which she traditionally throws her staff before turning to stone

CASWALLON
Origin: Celtic: Welsh
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: CASWALLAWN, CADWALLON, CATWALLAWN, CASSIVELLAUNUS, CASSIVELLAUNOS
It is difficult to separate human hero and tutelary god in the many sources in which his name appears. The variations of his name give a clue to this conflation: Caswallon, Caswallawn, Cadwallon, Catwallawn, Cassivellaunus. He led British opposition to Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain in 43BC and was also the British leader who drove the Irish out of Môn (Anglesey). These two separate characters are conflated with the deity Caswallon, mythical Lord of Britain and probably the tutelary god of the Catuvellauni tribe

CATUBODUA
Origin: Celtic Gaul
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: CATHUBODIA
The name in proto-Celtic, means 'battle crow' and in standard Celtic cathu or cath = ‘fight’ and bodu = ‘rage, violence, fury’. The proto-Celtic is derived from a single inscription in Haute Savoie, eastern France and assumes that 'Athvbodvae' in the inscription has lost its initial 'C'. This also assumes that Atebodvae, Atebodvvs and Atebodvi as they appear in modern Austria and Slovenia are unrelated. The goddess appears to be identical to the Irish goddess BADB CATHA. Catubodua has been linked with the martial goddesses BOUDINA, BODUA and BOUDIGA, whose names are rooted in 'fighting' or 'victory' (see BOUDICCA). There are unattestable links between her and the Romans' VICTORIA, the Greeks' NIKE and the Nordic goddess SIGYN. She is linked to the Irish BADHBH CHATHA (‘Raven of Battle’) and thus to MORRIGAN

Another of her daughters is KORE. Ceres is the goddess of the corn, or grain, or agriculture as a whole, though her importance can scarcely be underestimated: she was also the goddess of initiation, civilisation, the law, and the protector of mothers and motherly love, women and marriage. She was also known as the Eternal Mother and the Sorrowing Mother. Her worship involved fertility rites and rites for the dead, and her chief festival was the Cerealia on April 12-19.

As a single god he is a member, with AH LUIC and HOBNIL, of a triad, and is the sworn enemy of CAMAZOTZ, the bat monster(s). After the Spanish Conquest the Chacs became more ‘human’ depicted as riding on horses and sometimes given the names of archangels. They continue to be worshipped by the Yucatan peasants today, with sympathetic magic, bird sacrifices and offerings of local mead. They are featured as fang-masked, with large round eyes and a long snoutlike nose. They are believed to pour rain out of the gourds they carry, and throw stone axes at the earth (lightning) or clouds (thunder). Their companions are frogs, who croak to herald the rain.
