DHU-SHARA
Origin: Arabia: Nabataean
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: DU-ESH-SHERA, DUSHARA, DUSHERES, DUŠARES, DUSHRAT
Dhu-Shara appears to have been a Northern Arabian deity whose cult spread to cover most of Arabia. A god of the Nabataeans, who lived around Petra (300BC to 300AD), he was probably adopted from the Edomites, whose DU-ESH-SHERA, ‘Lord of Shera’ (Shara or Seir) was named after the rocky mountain range that runs behind Petra, the chief city of both the Edomites and, later, the Nabataeans. ‘Dhu-Shara’ (the Eye, the Watcher) may itself have been an epithet of a still more ancient god, RUDA. Dhu-Shara’s symbol and dwellingplace is a block of stone, or baetyl, often square-cut in the ratio of 4 x 2 x 1, and this attribute gave rise to the notion of the altar, a familiar element in many religious practices to this day. The Greeks associated him with ARES, god of war, but the attribution may be wrong, stemming from one form of his name, Dush-ares. In the form Dushrat he is 'he who becomes', a solar god depicted as a dung-beetle (like KHEPRI of Egypt), rolling the sun between his forelegs. His sacred animals are the eagle and the panther. A stronger likelihood of descent is from ARSA (ARSU, ARSO), a war-god and cameleer. Dhu-Shara seems to have been a god of the daytime and sun. He survived into the Roman era: In 106AD, after the reorganisation of the Nabataean kingdom in conjunction with several adjacent cities of the Decapolis as the Roman province of Arabia, his cult continued to prosper, with a full panoply of priests and religious festivals. The coins of the province’s major cities in the imperial age show that by 177AD he had adopted a more human aspect: he is depicted as a young man with long flowing hair, though Dhu-Shara continued to be worshipped and represented in baetyl form for at least another century. In southern Arabia, Dhu-Shara is one of a trinity and possibly the chief, including the Great Goddesses AL QAUM and AL-‘UZZA or AL-Udha. (She'a) Al Qaum is a moon god and protector of caravan travellers and Al-‘Uzza is the evening star, Venus, goddess of human and religious devotion and a patron of 'living' water such as springs, therefore of fertility. In northern Arabia, Al-Qaum is transformed as Ares, Dhu-Shara remains the same, and Al’Uzza/Al-Lat is depicted as THEANDRIOS, ‘man-god’. See also ATARGATIS, MANAT(Manathu) and QAUSH

DIANA
Origin: Roman
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: LALA, ARTUMES
Diana, whose name probably means Bright One, is thought to have originated as a solar goddess in the Scythian steppes. She became a goddess of woodland, probably brought from Asia Minor, whose stature was probably enhanced by her later identification with the Greek ARTEMIS, the Roman SELENE (LUNA), from whom she derived her connection with the moon, and HECATE (TRIVIA), thus sometimes assuming the nomenclature D.Triformis in Latin literature. She may also be connected with LALA, an Etruscan goddess, with whom she shares some characteristics, though she is known among the Etruscans as ARTUMES. Both she and Artemis are sometimes depicted in sculpture as lifting their robes to display their genitals. She was the goddess of domestic animals and, as a fertility deity, of conception and delivery. Her principal place of worship was a grove on the shores of Lake Nemi, near Aricia, where she was worshipped as D. Nemorensis. Here she was associated with stream spirit EGERIA, who shared with her the ability to facilitate conception and childbirth, and is usually depicted as her servant and assistant midwife, and the woodland god VIRBIUS, the Italian equivalent of HIPPOLYTUS, who became her first priest, rex Nemorensis. In her urban manifestation she was seen as the protectress of the slaves and lower classes, and her festival on August 13 was a Roman holiday for slaves. She is depicted as the daughter of JUPITER by LATONA, and as a triple-goddess her aspects are often named as HEKATE, LUCINA and PHOEBE. As D. Lucina she is, like JUNO, a goddess of childbirth. She is linked with VESTA in that, at least from Claudius’s time, a perpetual fire burned in her round temple at Nemi. In Rome her most important temple was on the Aventine, where she was seen as the sister of APOLLO, sharing an August 13 festival. They were worshipped together in the secular games. Roman art depicts her as a huntress with bow and quiver, accompanied by a hound or deer, and in later Roman times she is the bringer of, and protectress from, disease

Category: Deity
Aliases: DIEVAS, DEIVAS, DEWING, DIEVA DELI, DIEVAS SENELIS, NONADIEVIS, NUNADIEVIS, PRAAMŽIUS, PRAMŠANS, PRAMŽIMAS, PRAAMŽIMAS, OKOPIRMAS
‘Dievs’ is Latvian for ‘god’. Dievas is its Lithuanian form, and Deivas is Old Prussian. Dievas is the Lithuanians' chief god. The words are etymologically related to the Indo-European deiuos, from which is derived the ancient Indian DYAUS, Germanic TIWAZ the Greek ZEUS and the French DIEU. The Indo-European word originally meant simply sky, ‘Dievturiba’ is the state of being the possessor of god, and other forms and aspects include NONADIEVIS or NUNADIEVIS, surmised as a possible medieval spelling mistake; DEWING, DIEVINI, DIEVA DELI, DIEVAS SENELIS - 'Good Old Man'; teacher of people and judge of their morality. He looks like an old travelling beggar. He is proficient in magic and medicine. Dievs is sometimes called Praamžius, Pramšans, Pramžimas, Praamžimas or Okopirmas in folklore and is the god of creation, the sky, lightness, peace and friendship in parallel Lithuanian mythology. One creation legend tells that Dievs sent his brother VELNIAS (or VELINAS or PATULAS) to the bottom of the primeval ocean to bring up some dirt to make dry land. The dirt washed away each of three times, so Dievs took some dirt from under Velnias’ fingernail, formed it into a seed which became a tiny island. Dievs and Velnias slept on the island but during the night Velnias tried to drown his brother by dragging him to the water. Wherever Dievs was dragged, dry land formed. Another story tells how Dievs was washing his face when one dirty drop dropped on the ground and became a human. Thus, Dievs is a deity of the earth and of human creation, but he’s also responsible for vegetation, and his sacred tree is the birch, though all deciduous trees are his own. He is the deity of rye-grass. His sacred animals are horses, stags, bulls and small birds. As the guardian of moral law, he rewards good and punishes evil. Dievs’ wife is called DIEVU MOTĖ or LADA. Dievs, sometimes depicted as a John Bull-style gentleman farmer riding a horse or driving a cart, owns a farmstead in the sky mountain, but doesn’t work it; he leaves that to his sons, the DIEVA DELI. As bridegroom he rides a chariot to his symbolic wedding with the sun goddess SAULE. As a warrior god, according to medieval chronicles, he is invoked in battle as ANDAJUS, ANDAJAS or ANDOJAS

Origin: Roman
Sex: N
Category: Deity

A generic term for six linked pairs of Roman deities. In 217 BCE the Senate ordered a special festival called a lecistratum to be held in honour of the Dii Consentes. Six gods and six goddesses were honoured in the ceremony, in which their images were set out on couches upon the Capitoline, to share a sacred meal with the people of Rome. The Dii Consentes were then regarded as the celestial deities who headed the Roman pantheon. These particular deities – JUNO and JUPITER, APOLLO and DIANA, CERES and NEPTUNE, MARS and VENUS, VESTA and VULCANUS – were selected as the Dii Consentes because of their close identity with the Olympian gods of Greek myth

Origin: Greek
Sex: M

Aliases: DIONYSIUS, DIONYSOS, DEUNYSOS, ZONNYSOS, LIBER, BROMIOS
A god of trees and vegetation in general, the vine specifically, though he is linked to the growth of figs, ivy, pine trees, flowers and blossom. His worship may have originated in Thrace, though more recent rearch suggests cultic origins in Lydia or Prygia. He is described as being the son of ZEUS, having sprung from Zeus’ hip, though his mother is SEMELE. J G Frazer believes his similarity to Egypt's OSIRIS (qv) in terms of myth and worship linked merely by the similarity of the nature of death and rebirth, not by cultural export. Son of Zeus, who visited Persephone as a serpent, he was born as the horned infant ZAGREUS, which may relate to his depiction in ritual as a bull, or less frequently as a goat. He was killed, dismembered and eaten by Titans: this legend again was part of the ritual festival, in which a live bull or goat was pulled apart and eaten by devotees. He was the focus of a mystery fertility cult (the Dionysian Rites), whose chief festival was in March in Athens. He was the god of wine and his Greater and Lesser Dionysia and Agrionia festivals featured heavy wine-drinking, a parade of giant phalluses and much sexual debauchery. His Roman equivalent is BACCHUS – curiously, a name that may be Semitic for 'wailing'. As BROMIOS . .. ? The Greeks traded with the Nabataeans in southern Palestine - as did most of the ancient world 2,000 years ago - and found great similarities between Dionysius and DUSARES, or DU-ESH-SHERA, the god certainly of the Nabataeans and perhaps of the earlier Edomites, who occupied the same site of Petra

Aliases: DIUS FIDUS, SANGUS, SEMO SANCIUS
One of the Roman pantheon's earliest and most respected deities, associated both with JUPITER and his son HERCULES, though scholars appear to have difficulty separating out the three's powers and origins. He is the god of trust (fides), honesty and oaths. In earliest Roman times, as Dius Fidius (sometimes Fidus), he could have been seen as Hercules, Fidius being probably an early form of filius, or son (of Jupiter). The Umbrian god FISUS SANCIUS is clearly related, and Fisus is a Sabine word, the exact equivalent of the Roman 'fidius'. In the later Roman period he is known as SEMO SANCUS DIUS FIDIUS, and is not a mere aspect of Jupiter: he is a deity in his own right, though both are seen as sanctifying oaths, and the shrines to both are open-roofed, since it was considered deceitful to swear an oath under a roof (ie, hidden from god, who might strike the oath-breaker with a lightning bolt)

The animals they created are the clans' talismans, and the places the sisters visited are the clan shrines. The dances, singing, sculpture and ceremonies attached to the enactment of the myth are also celebrated by the Yiritjam, another Arnhem Land clan group. The cermony may be a dramatic enactment of the Arnhem Land monsoon cycle

A widespread and aggressive war-symbol from the 10th century BC onwards in Carpathia (Hungary, Sovakia and parts of Poland and the Ukraine), Draco can be found in one form or another through Dacia, (present day countries of Romania and Moldova, as well as smaller parts of Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and Ukraine), Thrace, (centred on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey) Scythia (The Pontic-Caspian steppes – that is, the Ukraine, southern Russia and western Kazakhstan) and Sarmatia (the Ukraine and eastern Balkans). He is depicted with the head of a wolf on the body of a snake with tassels attached used held aloft, technically to ascertain wind direction, but a terrifying audio-visual sight confronting Greek and Roman armies. The Dacians saw Draco as a manifestation of the sky demon or 'heavenly dragon'. There's a possible link here to the constellation Draco, the point of whose tail, the Pole Star, remains apparently static in the sky. This relates to their supreme god ZALMOXIS who was a sky god. In the Hallstatt Period, the decorative pattern of a dragon head or a serpent became quite common in Dacia

Durga is the material manifestation of the supreme and absolute godhead BRAHMAN and is said to exist inaccessibly and invincibly outside the universe - yet she is one of Hinduism’s most respected, admired and worshipped entities. The story of her creation and her most spectacular battle appears in many variations. Essentially, a demon named MAHISHASURA, who cannot be killed by a man, terrorises heaven, earth and the underworld. The gods go to Brahman, who confesses he can do nothing. The gods become so angry they emit white light, out of which emerges Durga. She immediately takes on the name of the priest, KATYAAYANI, in whose presence she first emerges. She (and sometimes her own army) fights the demon, and both combatants shift shape. Finally, Durga kills Mahishasura by decapitation midway in a change from a demon to a buffalo. As a result, she is sometimes known as MAHISHASURAMARDINI, or Mahishasura-slayer. For shaktis, that branch of Hinduism which believes the universe is governed by the divine creative feminine force, Durga is the warrior aspect of this force, and is seen by them as possessing the combined energies of the gods. Her peaceful form is MAHA GAURI, or the Fair Lady. In northern India she is the gentle bride, symbolising famiy unity: the eternal virgin, sometimes known as ADI SHAKTI, the first or original power, or ADI MAYA, the master illusionist. She is depicted as having up to 18 arms, each arm wielding a weapon that is a gift from other gods. She rides a tiger or lion and carries a lotus flower. In the Maharashtra region she is called TULJA or TULAJA BHAVANI, AMBABAI or AMBA, RENUKA,YAMAI, SAPTSHRUNGI or JOGAI. In Mysore Kanataka she is known as CHAMUNDESHWARI. In Calicut, on the Malabar Coast, she is the ultimate deity TAMERANI or TAMBURAN. On Goa, she is SRI SHANTADURGA. Almost universally in Hinduism, she is seen as the mother of GANESHA, LAKSHMI and SARASWATI. The West seems to have known Durga by the names of DEUMUS, DEMUS or DEUMO. In India she has the epithets KUMARI, SHAKTI, AGNI-DURGA and APARAJITA

DYEUS
Origin: Proto-Indo-European; Hindu
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: DYEUS PHYTER, DYAUS-PITR, DYAUS-PITAR, PRABHĀSA
Thought to have been the chief deity of many proto-Indo-European groups, his name is a back-construct from etymological and cultural remnants: he is not in his earliest form the subject of inscriptions. Early Hinduism associates him with the goddess PRTHIVI, wich whom he created the rest of the Vedic pantheon. His role in myth is superseded by INDRA. Dyeus is the god of the daylight sky: the name means 'Heaven Father'. (as DYEUS PHITER or DYAUS-PITR with attributes almost identical to those of TENGRI. PRABHĀSA means 'shining dawn'. Variants of his name are visible across Europe and Asia: Dyeus surfaces among the Greeks as ZEUS, and Dyeus Phiter is the Romans' JUPITER. DYAUS PITA or PITR is the Vedic (proto-Indian) god of the sky, Sanskrit DYÀUSPÍTAH. There are possible etymological links too with DIONYSUS and the Thracian SABAZIOS, or Saba Zeus, and there is speculation that the Slavic sky-deity SVAROG is also a 'descendant'. The Indo-European root-word 'deiwos' gave rise to the Latin 'deus' (god). He surfaces as DEVA and DAEVA in Indo-Iranian, as the Baltic religions' DIEVAS, the Estonian THERAPITA, the Finns' TAIVAS, the Gaulish/Celtic DĒUOS, TIVAR and TYR in Old Norse and the Germanic deity TIWAZ even turns up in Tuesday, 'Tiwaz's day'. In English, the words divine and deity are derived from this god's name and modern Greek and Romance languages all have variants of his name for 'god'
