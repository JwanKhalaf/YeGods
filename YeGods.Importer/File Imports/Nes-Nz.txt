NINIB
Origin: Babylonia
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: NIN-GURSU, NINGURSU
A minor Babylonian sun-god whose cult was ultimately absorbed by that of SHAMASH, he is one of the most ancient of Babylonian deities. He appears in inscriptions at Shirgulla (formerly Lagash) as NIN-GIRSU or ‘Lord of Girsu’, an area of the city, and is repeatedly designated as the son of BEL or EN-LU of Nippur, whose rulers administered Shirgulla for a time. Ninib has two conflicting attributes: he is the healing god who banishes demons, but he is also the god of war and the chase, armed with awesome weapons. There is some evidence that these two attributes represent different phases of the sun-year, possibly spring (healing) and high summer (destruction) and Ninib may have accumulated them by subsuming qualities of even earlier deities. There’s more confusion, because the contemporary sun-god NERGAL is also seen as the god of the summer solstice. Perhaps we should attribute the vernal sun to NINIB, and leave Nergal in charge of midsummer. Ninib’s astrological planet is Saturn and his sacred animal the pig. His consort is GULA

Aliases: ARURU, NINKHARSAG, NINMAH, NINMAG, NINMENNA, AMA-DUG-BAD, AMA-UDUDA, NIN-SIS-SIG, NINTU, NINTUR, NIN-ZIZNAK
Originally ARURU, she is a mother/fertility goddess, 'sacred lady of the mountains', and one of the seven great deities of Sumer. H|er cult centre and primary temple was at Eridu, with a second centre at Kish. Temple hymn sources identify her as the 'true and great lady of heaven' and kings of Sumer were invested and 'nourished by Ninhursag's milk'. Her hair is sometimes depicted in an omega shape. She often wears a horned headdress and tiered skirt, with bow cases at her shoulders, and sometimes carries a mace or baton surmounted by an omega-like motif or a derivation. She may be accompanied by a lion cub on a leash. She had many names deriving from her many roles as mother of all people, birth-bringer, king-maker, oath-guardian and controller of destiny; these are listed for the earlier ARURU, whose identity she absorbed. According to legend her name was changed from NINMAH to Ninhursag by her son NINURTA in order to commemorate his creation of the mountains. As the wife and consort of Enki she was also referred to as DAMGULANNA, the 'great wife of heaven' or DAMKINA, 'faithful wife'. As mother of the gods she is identified with KI in the Babylonian epic the Enuma Eliš. A legend links the god ENKI specifically to Ninhursag. She bears Enki a daughter, NINSAR, 'lady of greenery'. Enki sires a daughter NINKURRA on his own Ninsar, and then sires a daughter, UTTU, on his grand-daughter Ninkurra. The lustful and eternally virile ENKI then pursues his great grand-daughter for sex. On Ninhursag's advice, Uttu buries Enki's semen, out of which sprout the first eight plants. Enki eats them and becomes ill. Ninhursag cures him by taking the plants into her own body and from them giving birth to eight deities – ABU, NINTULLA (NINTUL), NINSUTU, NINKASI, NANSHE (NAZI), AZIMUA, NINTI and ENSHAG(AG). As Ninmah in creation stories she is midwife as the mother goddess NAMMU creates an assortment of human beings from clay at a feast given by Enki

Inanna's planet is Venus; Ninshubur is associated with Mercury, a planet visible in the sky at the same time, and thus ultimately with HERMES. Ninsuhubur pleads with ENKI for Inanna's release from the underworld. In some stories she is a virgin, in other, one of Inanna's lovers. In later Assyrian mythology, Ninshubur makes the transition from female to male, appearing in 'A Hymn to Nergal' as a minister of the underworld

A healing goddesses, the daughter of AN and consort of NINURTA, she was created by NINHURSAG to heal ENKI; her speciality was the 'rib', giving rise to the suggestion that this Sumerian legend may have given the Old Testament writer(s) the idea for the Adam and Eve story. She has seven healing daughters, the most prominent of which was HEGIR-NUNA, also known as GANGIR. She is likely to be a development of the Akkadian BAU BABA, also known later (after the first Babylonian dynasty) as GULA, BĒLET, or BALĀTI. She was the 'great healer of the land' which suggests she was a vegetation or regeneration deity as well as a patron of personal wellbeing. She was a tutelary deity of Lagash

NINURTA
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer, Akkad, Babylon
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: NINGURSU, NINIB, NINIP
Ninurta/Ninib/Ninip may have started out as a solar deity, but soon became the Sumerians' and later the Akkadians' chief god of war, with a cult centre at Lagash. In this he is the equivalent of Ningursu, tutelary god of Lagash, one of Mesopotamia's oldest cities, northwest of the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and east of Uruk. As Ningursu his consort is BAU. In the central and sacred city of Nippur, Ninurta was worshipped in triad with his father ENLIL and mother NINLIL. His consort here is UGALLU. In some literature, Ninurta's mother is the harvest goddess NINHURSAG. Ninurta often appears holding a bow and arrow, a sickle sword or a mace called Sharur which, in the Sumerian legend Deeds And Exploits of Ninurta, is capable of speech. He can take the form of a winged lion. A Babylonian legend tells how the birdlike monster IMDUGUD (Akkadian: ANZÛ) steals the Tablets of Destiny – which contained the fate of all living things - from Ninurta's father Enlil. Ninurta kills a succession of Anzu's fellow monsters and finally Anzu himself, retrieving the Tablets and returning them to his father. The similarities between this and the later stories of MARDUK, son of ENKI, who kills ABZU/APSU and retrieves the Tablets of Destiny from KINGU, returning them to his father, are inescapable

The creator goddess, first mother earth, of the Khond (or Kondh) tribal people of Orissa (or Odisha), on India's east coast, though most Hindus believe that Nirantali was sent by the gods to create the world. She carried with her banyan tree seeds wrapped in leaves. She first created the sun, the moon and the earth and then human beings. The sun beat down on the unsheltered humans so she gave them the banyan seed to plant for shade. The seeds grew, but the tree was a disappointment as regards shade, so Nirantali pulled on the tiny leaves so that they became huge, and stretched the branches until they reached the ground. Buddhists also revere the banyan tree: Buddha sat in the shade of one after enlightenment. Human sacrifices were made to the goddess until the middle of the 19th century

NISABA
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases: NIDABA, NIDABAL, NANIBGAL
Nisaba is the Sumerian goddess of writing, learning and the harvest. Her sanctuaries were at Uruk (Aramaic: Erech) and at Umma in southern Mesopotamia. She is the daughter of AN(U) and URASH, and the sister either of NANSHE or of NINSUN/NINSINA, mother of hero-king GILGAMESH. The language used to describe Urash is very similar to that used to describe NINHURSAG, and if these two goddesses are the same, then Nisaba is the half-sister (and chief scribe) of NANSHE and possibly also NINURTA. It gets more complicated. In some legends she is described as the mother of NINLIL and thus the mother-in-law of ENLIL. God of wisdom ENKI organised the world after creation and made Nisaba the scribe to the gods and teacher of earthly scribes, building her a school. She keeps a record of events, notes vows and marks boundaries. She is a goddess of knowledge amd wisdom. On the first day of each new year she and Nanshe settle humans' disputes and distribute aid to the needy. Nisaba is also the guardian of Ninhursag's temple at Kish. In the Babylonian period the god NABU/NEBO takes over her functions, though there appears to be a brief period in which Nisaba is Nabu's instructor or wife. On a depiction found in Lagash, northwest of the Euphrates/Tigris confluence and east of Uruk, she appears with flowing hair, crowned with horned tiara bearing supporting ears of grain and a crescent moon, these latter symbols giving her earth-mother status

He is one of the earliest Norse gods, starting life as a fertility deity, and most likely the masculination of an even earlier deity, the goddess NERTHUS. Originally married to his (unnamed) sister, by whom he was father to FREYR and FREYJA, he was obliged to terminate that incestuous relationship when he left the Vanir to join the AESIR: he married SKADI, the daughter of a giant, but the marriage failed because neither partner could persuade the other to leave their home environment; Njord the seashore, Skadi the mountains

NUSKU
Origin: Mesopotamia: Sumer, Assyria, Babylon
Sex: M
Category: Deity
Aliases: NUSKA, GIRRA, GIRRU, GIBIL
Nusku is the light and fire god of Babylonia and Assyria, the symbol of heavenly as well as of terrestrial fire at least after his amalgamation with the older Sumerian god GIBIL. In the Assyrian period he is indistinguishable from GIRRA or GIRRU. As Girru/Girra he is the son of ANU, god of heaven and his consort ŠALA(Š), but he also has close links with ENLIL of Nippur as god of the earth, and is depicted as Enlil’s firstborn son. Originally a Kassitic deity, Girru later equated with NERGAL. Girru, Gibil and Nusku are one god by the time of the late Babylonian ascendancy, though Girru and Nusku survive separately because they appear to be two aspects of Mercury, Girra representing the morning 'star' Nusku the evening. A centre of Girru's cult in Assyria was in Harran, where he is viewed as the son of the moon god SIN. Nusku/Girra's symbol, a torch (he is never depicted anthropomorphically) in the context of temple and domestic worship indicates that he is a deity of divine as well as terrestrial fire and a protector of the family hearth. He is also the patron of metallurgists and brick-makers, for whom the use of fire was a part of their daily lives. He plays an important part in the routines of ritual purification and protection from disease and is invoked in the same breath as EA, MARDUK and SHAMASH. In the Enuma Elis Girra (in the form of Gibil) is represented as one of the 50 aspects of MARDUK and shares a temple with Nusku in Nippur, but as Nusku he is closely associated with ENLIL, the earth-god whose first-born son he is, and whose temple is also in Nippur. Nusku's cult centre in Assyria at Harran is shared by the moon god SIN, and he is sometimes said to be the moon-god's son, a relationship that conflicts with the mainstream mythos. Nusku-Girru is by the side of EA, the god of water, the great purifier and in this association becomes the guardian of the sick, cleanser and the bringer of good health. As fire god, though, he is patron of the arts and of civilisation, control of fire being a mark of human progress. It is he, therefore, who is called upon to cleanse the sick and suffering from disease, which, superinduced by the demons, was looked upon as a species of impurity affecting the body. Nisku was a popular god of the people, evidenced by his prominence in incantations, and it is significant that in the astro-theological system of the Babylonian priests Nusku-Girru is not assigned to any particular place in the heavens

NUT
Origin: Egyptian	
Sex: F
Category: Deity
Aliases:	NEUTH, NUIT
In earliest references, Nut is just a fertility goddess who had many children. In the Heliopolis-based cosmology, Nut (‘the starry sky’), goddess of the sky and heavens, is the sister and wife of GEB (‘the earth’), both of whom were born from SHU and TEFNUT. To Geb and Nut were born the gods ISIS, OSIRIS, NEPHTHYS, SETH and, in some legends, HORUS. The hieroglyph of her name is thought to be a womb although a water pot represented the womb. She was typically depicted as a woman with her elongated and naked body arching above Shu and the earth god Geb to form the heavens. Sometimes she appears in the form of a cow whose body forms the sky and heavens, reminiscent of representations of HATHOR. Nut protects and upholds the barrier separating the forces of Chaos from the ordered cosmos in this world. Her fingers and toes are believed to touch the four cardinal points or directions. The sun god RA was to be reborn from her vagina each morning. Nut was also a goddess of the dead, and the Pharaoh was said to enter her body after death, from which he would later be resurrected. Her principal sanctuary was in Heliopolis

The supreme creator deity, bisexual, creator of mother earth and father sky, and has three names: Nzame, MEBERE and NKWA. After Nzame created the earth and brought life to it, the triad decided to create a ruler. They produced the elephant, leopard and monkey but the arrangement was unsatisfactory, so they produced a creature in their own image, called FAM (power). Fam eventually grew arrogant, mistreating the animals and abusing Nzame. Angered, Nzame destroyed everything except Fam, who had been promised immortality. The triad then recreated the earth by adding a new layer of soil. A tree that grew in it dropped seeds on the land, which grew into more trees, and dropped leaves into the water which became fishes. Nzame then made a new, mortal, man whom he called Sekume. Sekume made himself a woman Mbongwe, from a tree
